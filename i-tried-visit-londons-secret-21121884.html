No. It just has smelly Thames-soaked sand.</p><p>The Path itself offers a lovely river-adjacent walk from Bermondsey to London Bridge, and there are numerous points at which you can stop and snap gorgeous pics of the Shard or Tower Bridge.</p><p>ou can then, if you like, walk back through Bermondsey Street and pick up some ice cream or visit an art gallery.</p><p>Can you do that at a beach? No.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article21121814.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_8960bbda-858d-4b5a-94bf-9d39530a1c31.jpg><p>If you don't fancy a long walk you can - as I did - take a stroll back through the modest but nonetheless beautiful Southwark Park, which doesn't smell of sewage.</p><p>Here you'll find wide expanses of verdant paradise both in and out of shade, ice cream vans, and a perfectly serviceable cafe.</p><p>As I made my way home through the park, I realised I didn't actually want to visit the beach in the first place - I just wanted to be outside.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article21121843.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_7a9dd3b2-9cdd-4bb7-a15a-faa287693a0f.jpg><p>And where better to spend the day than in the natural beauty of Southwark Park?
