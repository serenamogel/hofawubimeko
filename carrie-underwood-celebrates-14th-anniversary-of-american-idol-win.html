Carrie beat out some fierce competition in the form of <strong>Bo Bice</strong>, <strong>Vonzell Solomon</strong> and <strong>Constantine Maroulis</strong> for the crown.</p><p>Since that momentous day in 2005, Carrie has gone on to amass seven Grammy Awards and release six studio albums. She has become one of the biggest women in country music and is known for her hits like “Jesus, Take the Wheel” and “Before He Cheats.”</p><p>Personally, also married her <a href=#>husband, Canadian <strong>Mike Fisher</strong></a>, in 2010. She and the former professional hockey player have two children together, sons <a href=#>Isaiah</a> and <a href=#>Jacob</a>.</p><p>Just two years ago, Carrie reminisced about winning the singing competition show. “12 years later and I’m still not sure how it all happened to me!” the Oklahoma native <a href=#>wrote in 2017</a>. “12 years ago today, my dreams came true and life has beena. dream ever since! I am beyond blessed and so thankful! #AmericanIdol #TBT.”</p><p>While we all love Carrie for all those amazing performances on American Idol, it’s not the only thing we remember about that time. Who could forget the time <a href=#>she revealed her third nipple during the auditions</a>? Certainly not us, that’s for sure.</p><p>Time sure flies when you’re conquering the music world, doesn’t it?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46cmKuqmZp6trrDnqmwp5%2BZeqSxy56Zq5mkmsBufZOtn2aZnqO2t7HRrJirsV2ks26tzJ6popuRo3qqsM6lZLChnmQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./are-oscar-isaac-elvira-lind-still-together-explore-more-on-oscar-isaac-new-girlfriend-2.html><span>←</span><span>Are Oscar Isaac &amp;amp; Elvira Lind Still Together?
