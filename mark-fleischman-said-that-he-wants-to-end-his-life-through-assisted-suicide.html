On Saturday, he told a news source that he wanted to terminate his life with the help of Dignitas, an assisted suicide charity.&nbsp;In an interview with the New York Post, he explained his choice, saying that he is unable to help himself and is now faced with the alternative of suicide. He said,&nbsp;‚ÄúI can‚Äôt walk, my speech is messed up, and I can‚Äôt help myself.‚Äù My wife assists me in getting into bed, and I am unable to dress or put on my shoes.

When founders Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager were charged with tax evasion, obstruction of justice, and conspiracy, he took over the club in 1978.&nbsp;Mark paid $4.75 million for the studio, which he sold to new owners in 1984. He then authored a book, Inside Studio 54, in which he discussed the club in-depth.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Mark-Fleischman-2.jpg alt="Mark Fleischman" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Studio 54 began as the Gallo Opera House, an entertainment facility, in 1927. In 1942, however, CBS began using it as a radio and television studio known as Studio 52.&nbsp;The club became well-known for its celebrity guest lists, tight admittance rules, drug usage, and open s*xual activities. Mark bought it in 1980, sold it to new owners in 1984, and it has been a venue for Roundabout Theatre Company Broadway performances since 1998.&nbsp;Fleischman‚Äôs family, date of birth, job, and educational history have yet to be disclosed.</p><h2>Mark Fleischman‚Äôs health problems</h2><p>Mark Fleischman told the New York Post that he had been suffering from an unexplained illness since 2016. When asked about his intention to commit suicide, he said that he had been contemplating it for two years.&nbsp;He even attempted to do it himself, but physicians at the emergency hospital saved his life. Mimi, his wife of 27 years, intervened when he began contemplating different ways. Fleischman said that they were looking for a location where they could locate someone who could do it lawfully.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Mark-Fleischman-3.jpg alt="Mark Fleischman" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Mark‚Äôs partner mentioned that he has found it tough to deal with his situation since he is unable to walk and lacks balance. Mimi added that Mark drops things and has no idea where his body is in space and that physicians assumed he had Parkinson‚Äôs disease, but it was a mistaken diagnosis.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Mark Fleischman</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Studio 54 nightclub</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGikmqqbYrOtscismqGlkaN6tK3InWStoJGpeqmxjLCYp6yjYsGwecSnm2agmah6rbXFnmStoKKkwqi0jJqqrKGjqbKledKuoJyhlJp8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./history-of-the-world-part-ii-movie-review-2023.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>History of the World, Part II movie review (2023)</span></a>
