According to&nbsp;Bjergsø, he and Astley had known each other for a few years at that point, having become friends after collaborating on creating the singer's branded beer, Astley's Northern Hop Lager.&nbsp;</p><p>"Mikkel and his crew only do things the right way, and I love being a small part of that and working on fantastic beers and the London bars together,"&nbsp;added Astley. "I believe people want quality, and that's what you get from Mikkeller."</p><p>As Astley told <a href=#>The Guardian</a>, it was his music that provided the catalyst for he and&nbsp;Bjergsø to join forces and forge a friendship.&nbsp;Bjergsø, he recalled, had been a longtime fan, and once he became successful in the craft beer field, he typically sent samples to Astley, who grew to become a fan of the beer. However, he pointed out, there were limits.&nbsp;"Some of them too weird to drink,"&nbsp;he explained. "He and his team call themselves beer geeks, because that's what they are really, to be frank."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtkZoZ2fY6wn5qslauys3nHmqepnZ6asW6%2ByJyiZpmjqbmmxY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joseph-bruce-violent-j-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Joseph Bruce (Violent J) Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</span></a>
