So, what else does she do? As it turns out, Denberg is also an ordained minister! "It's my favorite thing to do. I got ordained as a minister to marry my oldest friend in the world to his now-wife," she dished to <a href=#>ABC News</a>. "I wrote a whole specialized ceremony for them and people just loved it. They said, 'This is so great. You should do this. You should offer this service.' So, I took their advice!"</p><p>As for giving fans advice as she did on "Vital Information" so long ago? "People always ask me to do it and I never do," Denberg told <a href=#>HuffPost</a>. "We also just started giving, like, actual adult vital information. At Comic-Con in New York, we were like, 'If you're going to rent an apartment, get renter's insurance. It's in your best interest.'" She did warm hearts in May 2019, however, as she made <a href=#>a guest appearance</a> as the Loud Librarian yet again for Nickelodeon's All That reboot.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmam9hZ312e9OhnKydXaO2pLfEpaadnZ%2BjerTAwKuqZpmimru1ecCsZKuhk516or%2BMsqaunF2ptaq6ymg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taylor-swift-fans-diapers.html><span>←</span><span>Taylor Swift Fans Are Wearing Adult Diapers to Concerts</span></a>
