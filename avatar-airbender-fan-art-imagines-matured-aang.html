The delicate glasses are a nice touch, too, giving him a reserved and intellectual countenance that contrasts the excitable and impulsive personality he displayed as an adolescent, and given how much time Aang likely spent reading as he grew up to catch up on the world history he missed, it’s entirely possible he developed near-sightedness.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/104163298_701538390640666_4542385049628463230_n.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/105379259_3283021138415170_342099626420090088_n.jpg><p data-characters=415 data-current-count=415 data-injectable=true>The modern-style clothing is not as anachronistic as might be thought of at first glance, since after the defeat of Fire Lord Ozai and the end of the century-long war enveloping the whole planet, the world of Avatar began to swiftly develop, and when the story picks up 70 years later with the commencement of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Legend of Korra</a>, it had gone from a pseudo-feudal fantasy setting to a dawning industrial revolution.</p><p data-characters=608 data-current-count=608 data-injectable=false>Few stages of Aang’s life have been depicted officially, as he passed away at the comparatively early age of 66 as a result of his life force being drained by spending a century in the Avatar State while trapped in the iceberg. He occasionally appeared in spirit form, guiding Korra in the same way his predecessor Roku advised him, and looked somewhere in the vicinity of 40 when doing so. These images of him in his 20s though spark the imagination of the kind of person he initially matured into after the events of <strong>Avatar: The Last Airbender</strong>, reminding us there are all sorts of stories yet to be told.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yiwsCtmKtlkZ6%2Fo7HNnZyrZZaWu26t0a1koqWRnLavsdJmpJqspaeypXnAmqWgZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-i-think-im-k00l-nast-2002-by-lil-tracy.html><span>←</span><span>The Meaning Behind The Song: I THINK IM K00L NAST *2002* by Lil Tracy</span></a>
