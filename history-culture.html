Choo rose to fame for the quality and style of his handmade women's shoes.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Years</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Jimmy Choo Yeang Keat was born in 1948 in Penang, Malaysia. The son of a shoe cobbler, Choo was immersed in the world of shoemaking from an early age. His father wanted him to follow in his footsteps, and by age 11, Choo had made his first pair of shoes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"When I first started, my father wouldn't let me make a shoe," recalled the designer. "Instead, he said: 'Sit and watch, sit and watch.' For months and months, I did that."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After learning from his father about the craft of shoemaking, Choo made his way to England in the early 1980s to study at the Cordwainers Technical College in Hackney, where he graduated with honors in 1983.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Career Beginnings and Success</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Choosing to remain in England, Choo opened his first shop in Hackney in 1986 in an old hospital building. It didn't take long for Choo's reputation to build. Within two years of opening his shop, Choo's shoes were featured in an eight-page spread in Vogue magazine.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Soon, Choo became the darling of the celebrity world, in particular <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/princess-diana data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Princess Diana" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Princess Diana</a>, who donned Choo's footwear seemingly everywhere she went.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But it was his relationship with Vogue that would prove to be instrumental in the rise of the Jimmy Choo brand. Despite the rise of his popularity, Choo was still a small operation, producing just 20 handmade pairs of shoes per week. But Tamara Yeardye Mellon, an accessories editor at Vogue, who often hired Choo to make shoes for fashion shoots, sensed a larger market for Choo's creations. She approached the shoemaker about partnering to create a line of ready-to-wear footwear.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Together, Choo and Mellon quickly grew the business, keeping the focus on creating high-end footwear, but no longer relying on the idea that every single pair had to be made by Choo himself. They contracted with Italian factories and opened their first boutique shop in London.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By the late 1990s, Choo had stores in Los Angeles and New York and lineup of adoring Hollywood celebrities that included <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/julia-roberts data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Julia Roberts" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Julia Roberts</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/renee-zellweger data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Renee Zellweger" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Renee Zellweger</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Going Out On His Own</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By the turn of the century, the Choo name was a global brand, with high-end retail clients that included Harrods and Saks Fifth Avenue carrying Choo footwear. The Choo brand had also expanded to handbags and other accessories.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But in the background, all was not well. Choo and Mellon were at odds about the direction of the company. In what would become one of the more fascinating rifts in the fashion industry, Choo didn't think bigger was better. He questioned the quality of the shoes the company was making, and seemed to long for the days when he was back at his shop in Hackney, making a small number of pieces of footwear for specific clients.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2001, Choo sold his half of the company to Robert Bensoussan of Equinox Luxury Holdings for $30 million.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Today, Choo has returned to his roots at a small shop he opened in London, which serves as the headquarters for the exclusive Jimmy Choo Couture line. It's here that Choo crafts a small number of pairs of shoes each week and trains a select group of students on how to make high-end footwear.</p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Personal Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">For Choo, a devout Buddhist, education has become a central part of his life. In recent years he has become an Ambassador for Footwear Education at the London College of Fashion and spokesperson for the British Council in its efforts to reach out to foreign students. Choo is also a recipient of the O.B.E. (Most Excellent Order of the British Empire).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">For all his success, the designer has not been immune to backlash. In late 2017, Choo released a commercial in which model/actress Cara Delevingne struts down the street amid catcalls and leering pedestrians, prompting accusations that company executives were tone deaf.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Choo, who has a daughter and a son, resides with his wife, Rebecca, in London.</p><ul data-node-id=36 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Jimmy Choo Yeang Keat</li><li>Birth Year: 1948</li><li>Birth date: November 15, 1948</li><li>Birth City: Penang</li><li>Birth Country: Malaysia</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Fashion designer Jimmy Choo rose to fame for the quality and style of his handmade women's shoes.</li><li>Astrological Sign: Scorpio</li><li>Nacionalities</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Malaysian (Malaysia)</li></ul></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><ul data-node-id=41 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Jimmy Choo Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/history-culture/jimmy-choo</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: September 9, 2022</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><ul data-node-id=44 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>When I first started, my father wouldn’t let me make a shoe.
