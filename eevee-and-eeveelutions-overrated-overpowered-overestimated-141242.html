Glaceon, Leafeon, Vaporeon, and Espeon were the stars of the family tree, while Umbreon, Jolteon, and especially Flareon could be outright the pits. It just depends on how you look at them (no, I don't mean appearance). They all had some form of strength, but Glaceon and Leafeon were the stars of the show.<p>Leafeon had high Attack and Defense, as well as great Speed, making it a good physical sweeper (and giving Grass-types a bit more backbone). All you really need with Leafeon was Leaf Blade, Swords Dance, Aerial Ace, and Dig and it could be a beast. I raised on in my spare Platinum, just to try it. I was not disappointed, and I'm not fond of Grass-types. Likewise, Glaceon (although a pain to evolve at that far point in the region) was best in Defense, Speed, and monstrous Special Attack. All it needed was Ice Beam, Water Pulse, Shadow Ball and Barrier and it could either sweep away its opponents, or stand strong against them.</p><p>I've used all of them over the course of the generations. At first, Vaporeon was my top Eevee form, giving me access to a quick and easy-to-raise Water-type. It still is high on my charts. The ones that were not so good were Jolteon, Umbreon, and Flareon. There were better Electric-types out there, so Jolty lost some luster, Umbreon is a good wall, but that's about its only strong point, while Flareon has the worse moves for its stats; more Special moves over Physical. The most "powerful" move Flareon could use with its proper Attack AND STAB is Fire Fang, the rest are all Special based. Espeon is, you can say, the middle-of-the-road; it has wicked moves and great Special Attack and Speed, but like most Psychic-types, it could fall pretty quickly to a Crunch or two.</p><p>Really, overall, the Eeveelutions can be categorized very easily: Awesome, Lacking, and Mid-ranged. Awesome would include: Glaceon, Leafeon, Vaporeon, in that order. Lacking would have: Umbreon, Jolteon, Flareon, in that order. And lastly, Mid-ranged is easy to figure out: Espeon. It's a mixed bag, depending on your choice and needs. The best thing about them is the fact you can decide what Eeveelution you want, whenever you want. You've got (currently) seven options. Whichever one fits your play style is the one you can decide you want to use. Sometimes, it's not about type advantage/disadvantage, but maximizing the strengths of the Eeveelution you picked. To put it simply, they are specialized players, fitting a particular niche, and doing that very well. It may mean they are lacking in various fields, but if you want a certain one for a particular situation, then there's a pretty good chance one of the Eeveelution can fit that bill. Just remember it that way: they are designed for a certain purpose in mind (i.e. Espeon: special sweeper, Umbreon: wall, Glaceon: special hitter/defender, etc).</p><p>In one sense, they can be overhyped, but most of that hype comes from Eevee's ability to pick the form most needed for a situation, and just stick with that. So, no the Eeveelutions are not <i>totally</i> overrated or overestimated, but some do pull out ahead over others. Basically, you just have to pick the one that best suits what you need it for. For me, for example, Glaceon and Leafeon can totally snuggle up in my party, since they've got what I look for in them. That's just how they roll, so you have to roll with them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHymsdWenGaZnpl6prHVnpylraSevK%2B%2FjKitnqqilsGmsIyorZ6qoKTEpr7EnWSorpWnsrTAyKaYrZ2UY351fZFtaWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shirley-bassey-siblings-meet-eileen-hopkins-henry-bassey-jr-marina-hogan-edith-grace-biami-ella-brutus-iris-denning.html><span>←</span><span>Shirley Bassey Siblings: Meet Eileen Hopkins, Henry Bassey Jr, Marina Hogan, Edith Grace Biami, Ella</span></a>
