Though he has always loved his daughter, Raymond's relationship with Brittney went through a rough patch in the past. It was when the WNBA star first revealed her sexual orientation.</p><p>Brittney first revealed being a lesbian on <i>February 11, 2013</i>, and it didn't go down well with Raymond. As the WNBA star has revealed, her father was disappointed in her and stopped loving her.&nbsp;</p><p>And with time, Raymond's relationship with his daughter even worsened. <a href=# rel=nofollow><i>Marca</i></a> has reported in their article that he also didn't allow Brittney's friends to come to his house. Fortunately, with time, he started to understand her daughter and finally accepted her for who she is.</p><h2>About Raymond's Famous Daughter, Brittney Griner</h2><p>Brittney Griner holds massive fame in women's basketball, but Brittney is also infamous in a way. She plays in the WNBA for the Phoenix Mercury. She is also one of the tallest athletes in the league, with a height of 6 Feet and 9 Inches! Moreover, Girner has the same body weight as <a href=#>Alan Ritchson</a>, i.e., 205 lbs (93 kg).</p><p>Brittney is considered one of the top athletes in the women's league! So, it shouldn't be surprising that she has some of the best stats in the WNBA. As per <i>ESPN</i>, her average points scored is 17.7, her rebounds are 7.6, and her assist percentage is 1.8%. She also has 35.3% three points and 80.4% Free Throws.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/4/16/unknown_217436824_340967027512117_7722658240539808605_n%20(1)-1681631627303.jpg><p>Raymond's daughter was first drafted into the league in 2013! Brittney has gone on to win a lot of awards. She has been honored with WNBA All-Star eight times, Peak Performer two times, and defensive player of the Year two times. She has also won two Olympic gold medals with her national team.</p><p>With fame comes a lot of hate, and Brittney, despite everything she has achieved, hasn't been able to command the same kind of respect. It has been through some of her past actions, like talking down on the NBA and making fun of DeMarcus Cousins. But also disrespecting the national anthem, among others.</p><h2>Is A Retired Sheriff</h2><p>Raymond Griner&nbsp;enjoys his retired life today, having previously served the community people. He worked to maintain law and order as he was a deputy sheriff. Brittney's father worked as a sheriff in Texas.</p><p>Griner&nbsp;has not disclosed much about his time while serving in this position. But, he was a good sheriff as he wasn't involved in any controversy during his time as the sheriff. Moreover, Raymond served in the Lone Star State.</p><h2>How Did Raymond Felt About Brittney's Arrest In Russia?</h2><p>The controversial athlete, Brittney Griner, was famously arrested in Russia on February 17, 2022. It was one of the toughest times for Brittney's family. Raymond Griner, who usually doesn't get involved with the media, had to do it to bring everyone's attention to help her daughter.</p><p>The former deputy sheriff even said in an interview with <i>Fox26 Houston</i> that this was the most cardinal thing to have happened to him. And it's no surprise that he was the happiest man alive when his daughter was finally released.</p><figure class=media></figure><p>Brittney was detained after Hash oil was discovered. Shockingly, she was later given a prison sentence of nine years. The government was involved in the case. And she was released by the Russians only after the Americans released the arms dealer <strong>Viktor Bout</strong>, famously nicknamed <i>The Merchant of Death</i>.</p><p>Many people were upset with the decision of the US government to let go of one of the deadliest men in the world. The Americans didn't celebrate the release of Raymond's daughter. Many people vented out their frustration on the internet and trending "Brittney Hates America" on Twitter.</p><h2>Fought In The Vietnam War</h2><p>Raymond Griner has not only experienced what it's like to maintain law and order in the state. But, he has also been on the front line as he was in the military before his sheriff days. He had fought in the famous Vietnam War.</p><p>Brittney's father fought in the Vietnam War for two years. In a two-decade-long war, Raymond revealed he was in combat in 1968 and 1969. He has even called this one of the most critical events to have happened to him.</p><p><i>Like Raymond Griner's bio?
