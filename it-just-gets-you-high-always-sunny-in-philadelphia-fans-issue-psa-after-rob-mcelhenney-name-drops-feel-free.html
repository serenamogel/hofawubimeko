The OP pointed out that what produces the high the actor speaks of is the herb kratom, which essentially replicates the effects of morphine and can not only be addictive but can be dangerous when taken in conjunction with other drugs, particularly sedatives. While kratom — derived from a tropical tree found in Southeast Asia — is a controlled substance in such areas as Canada, the U.K., Australia, and New Zealand, it remains legal in the U.S.</p><p data-characters=311 data-current-count=311 data-injectable=false>“Sorry to be a narc, gang,” the Redditor concluded, “but this stuff is dangerous for people who may be prone to addiction or who are using other drugs, for medicinal or recreational purposes. I was disappointed to hear them discuss it on the podcast without knowing what it actually is.”</p><p data-characters=497 data-current-count=808 data-injectable=true>As Howerton alludes to, Feel Free was created by Botanic Tonics founder Jerry Ross, a former addict who developed the drink for those dependent on alcohol and drugs. In April 2023, Botanic Tonics was hit by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a federal class-action lawsuit</a> from a former customer who claimed to have been hospitalized twice in a year due to his addiction to Feel Free, allegedly stemming from its high levels of kratom, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">which the FDA describes</a> as affecting “the same opioid brain receptors as morphine.”</p><p data-characters=162 data-current-count=162 data-injectable=false>Botanic Tonics has naturally denied the claims, responding: “We believe the suit is without merit and we will vigorously defend our product in court.”</p><p data-characters=87 data-current-count=249 data-injectable=false>It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia season 16 airs new episodes Wednesdays on FXX.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S2tXnJrqqtZZeawbR52KisZqCZnLVurcuwmLKrXajCr7rYZqCnZaCdtq2tw56jqaCZlnqnrc2sZKKro6qybrzSmmSanqSav26%2BzptkppuVobWmus2esGamkaKybrDRqKesZZaasq15xaucnmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./deborah-murray-obituary-a-friend-taken-too-soon.html><span>←</span><span>Deborah Murray Obituary, A Friend Taken Too Soon</span></a>
