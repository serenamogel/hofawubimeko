We’re not big football fans, but it wouldn’t be Super Bowl Sunday without Super Bowl snacks, right? If you’re watching the game on Sunday (or even if you’re not!), I hope you’ll try this recipe. I top a bed of crispy French fries with smoky plant-based chili and generous drizzles of vegan cheese. Yep, that’s right! These chili cheese fries are totally vegan. But more importantly, they’re tasty, satisfying, and really darn fun. What more could you want in a game day…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I’ve shared vegan sushi recipes before, but earlier this winter, I thought of another idea that I just had&nbsp;to try. I wanted to make vegan sushi that looked like, well,&nbsp;not&nbsp;vegan sushi. I thought that if I marinated pink Chioggia beets they’d look pretty darn similar to tuna. How cute would that be?! There was just one problem: Jack hates beets. Sure, he’ll eat certain beet recipes from time to time, but that only happens when I put a dish in front of him and don’t tell him what’s in it. And in our house, vegan sushi is one thing we…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Raise your hand if you love miso soup! Same. The cloudy broth is warming, nourishing, and deeply flavorful. On a cold, gray winter day, there’s nothing I crave more. It clears my head and warms me up from the inside out. For years, I only ate miso soup at Japanese restaurants. But after Jack and I traveled to Japan for the first time, we got curious about Japanese cooking at home. We cooked soba noodles, we made matcha, and we decided to try a miso soup recipe. I don’t know what I was expecting, but I certainly didn’t imagine the…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>These easy vegan appetizers prove how fun&nbsp;plant-based eating can be! As I compiled this list over the weekend, I found myself itching to make each one of these vegan appetizer recipes. They’re colorful, bold, and bright, the kind of food that makes you want to reach out and try it…and then go back for another bite. Whether you’re vegan, vegetarian, or someone who eats everything, you’re going to love these vegan appetizers! They range from creamy dips to refreshing salsas, from pretzels to spring rolls to bruschetta and beyond. Over the years, we’ve made them for parties, date nights, cookouts,…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Over the years, Jack and I have made so many steamed dumplings together. Like all our favorite cooking projects (sushi, bao buns), steamed dumplings have a simple division of tasks. I make the filling, and Jack makes the dumplings. Then, we eat! If you’re looking for a fun activity for a weekend, a date-night-in, or even New Year’s Eve, I hope you try this steamed dumplings recipe. It’s a blast to make, and it’s not at all complicated (thanks, store bought wonton wrappers!). Best of all, it’s delicious. The filling is spicy and savory, with a refreshing gingery kick. I…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>For me, there’s almost nothing more nostalgic than French onion dip and ridged potato chips. They take me right back to the holiday parties of my childhood, where store bought tubs of French onion dip had a permanent spot on the snack table. When my sister and I were growing up, my mom always served us healthy, homemade food, so that French onion dip was a real treat. I’d shovel down as much of it as I could, relishing every bite of the creamy dip with the salty chips. This year, I finally got around to developing my own French…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If you still have space for one more dish on your Thanksgiving menu, make this kohlrabi slaw recipe! It’s crisp and refreshing – the perfect way to balance out indulgent holiday fare like stuffing and mashed potatoes. Plus, it calls for just 10 ingredients, and it comes together in right around 15 minutes. You can chop the veggies, whisk up the dressing, and have it on the table in the time it takes to warm your dinner rolls or sweet potato casserole in the oven! The recipe comes my friend Andrea‘s new book&nbsp;Local Dirt: Seasonal Recipes for Eating Close to…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>By now, you probably have a good idea of your Thanksgiving menu. Maybe you’re sticking to classics like turkey, sweet potato casserole, and cranberry sauce, or maybe you’re trying something new. Mashed cauliflower? Mac and cheese? No matter what you’re serving, I hope you’re including a Thanksgiving salad. Why? For one, color! If you’ve been following Love & Lemons for a while, you know that I love highlighting the colors of every season. In the fall, so much&nbsp;colorful produce is at its peak, but it doesn’t always make its way onto our Thanksgiving tables, where mashed potatoes and gravy take…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Every year, I hear from readers asking for vegan Thanksgiving recipes. I always write back with an idea or two, but I never quite feel like my response is enough. I think one of the most joyous things about Thanksgiving is crafting a menu that you and your friends or family will love. So instead of sending a couple suggestions to each person who writes in, I wanted to create a whole collection of vegan Thanksgiving recipes for you to explore. And finally, it’s here! Below, you’ll find over forty of my best vegan Thanksgiving recipes. They include everything you…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>One of my many missions in life is to create fresh beet recipes that will win over even the biggest beet skeptics. Luckily, Jack has given me ample practice over the years. When we first met, he wouldn’t come near a beet, let alone taste one. But with time (and only a little trickery), I’ve gotten him to try and enjoy a host of beet recipes. Just last week, he devoured an entire beet salad at dinner, proclaiming how much he loved it with every bite. So if you’re still on the fence about beets, I get it. Their earthy…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If you love fall baking but need a break from pumpkin spice, make homemade soft pretzels! Way back in the early years of Love and Lemons, Jack and I shared a vegan soft pretzel recipe that continues to be one of the most popular recipes on the site. A few weeks ago, when we were in the mood for a fun weekend project, we decided to give the old recipe a go. Our homemade pretzels came out pretty well, but we thought we could make them even better. This soft pretzel recipe is a new and improved version of the…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbvVnpinnJyaurC60meaqKVfmK61scaoqbJnopqwqrzEZqCnnJWterO7zq1mpp2RoXyivM%2Beq6Kylad8sa3GnmZqaF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./magic-spoon-treats-review.html><span>←</span><span>Are Magic Spoon Treats Actually a Treat to Eat?</span></a>
