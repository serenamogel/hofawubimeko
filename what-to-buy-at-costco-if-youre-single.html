You’re all lucky that I love Costco so much and go way too often—any excuse to get a $1.50 hot dog and soda combo. As a frequent Costco shopper, I am very aware that the store can be minefield, especially if you’re shopping for one. So here’s my tip: If you want to avoid culinary tedium, variety packs are the move. No one person wants to get stuck eating 45 single serving bags of cheddar Goldfish on their own. It can be intimidating, but once you really start looking in the aisles, you’ll also notice a bunch of things that work for people who live alone. These are the sweet spots for those who are as single as a Pringle and looking to mingle in the aisles of Costco.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Kirkland Signature Variety Snack Box</strong></a><p>As a single person shopping at Costco, I’m well versed in the variety pack. If you’re afraid of monotony (or commitment—hey, maybe that’s why you’re single), the variety pack is your saving grave. But not all variety packs are created equal—some boast three different flavors, some have five, but this one tops them all. That’s right, there are seven different snacks in this one box. You’ve got <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-granola-bars/>bars</a>, you’ve got <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-trail-mix/>trail mix</a>, and even just straight-up <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-mixed-nuts/>nuts</a>. If you want to buy one thing that won’t leave you bored to death by the time you get to the bottom of the box, this is the choice for you!</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Bai Antioxidant Infusion Variety Pack</strong></a><p>This Bai variety pack has just four measly options, but this is about as good as it gets when you’re single and shopping for bottled drinks at Costco. We need something to wash down all those salty snacks in our bountiful snack box, so this seems like a good choice. If you like fruity drinks, grab this.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Kirkland Organic Maple Syrup</strong></a><p>This may be an unexpected choice, but I really stand by it. This jug of Kirkland maple syrup is gargantuan, yes, but it keeps well and we bet you’ll find a lot of uses for it. There it is in the fridge, silently encouraging you to make <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-pancake-mix/>pancakes</a> on a Saturday morning or to have a couple of <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-frozen-waffles/>frozen waffles</a> for dessert. It’s also good to have on hand in case you have anyone staying the night and you want to treat them well the next morning. It’s foolproof, delicious, and an easy way to save money on a product you’d buy at the grocery store anyway. A win-win-win. Hey, it’s also <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-maple-syrup/>Sporked crew approved</a>.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>DeeBee’s Organics SuperFruit Organic Freezie Pops</strong></a><p>If you’re a single person shopping at Costco, you should pretty much completely avoid the frozen section. The boxes are huge and (mostly) filled with a single item you’ll have to consume before freezer burn strikes. This box of DeeBee’s superfruit popsicles is an exception. First of all, these can be stored at room temp so you don’t have to put the whole box in the freezer, and there’s a nice little selection of flavors, too.</p><a href=#><strong>Buldak Stir-Fried Spicy Chicken Ramen</strong></a><p>Recommending ramen to all my fellow solo soldiers out there seems like a copout, but, hey, these are among Sporked’s favorite noodles, so just hear me out. Ramen has everything you’d want in a product from Costco when you’re on your own. It’s easy to make, even easier to store, and there are six servings in each pack, so it’s not that big of a mountain to climb on your own. Keep this on top of the fridge or in a closet somewhere, and you’ve got yourself six quick meals that’ll get you by until you go back to Costco for another $1.50 hot dog.</p><p><strong>Read our ranking of the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/every-flavor-of-buldak-noodles-ranked/>best Buldak noodles</a></strong></p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Catalina Crunch Keto Friendly Cereal Cinnamon Toast</strong></a><p>Most cereals that you’ll find at Costco come in tremendous quantities, so this Catalina Crunch is a more single-person-friendly option. Am I a little hesitant about “keto friendly cereal?” Sure, but the bag boasts 11 grams of protein per serving and the Sporked crew says it’s not half bad for a keto cereal. If you’re in need of more protein and don’t want a gigantic 50-ounce box of Cinnamon Toast Crunch lying around.</p><a href=#><strong>Double Chocolate Chunk Cookie</strong></a><p>I can talk about the $1.50 hot dog and soda combo to no end and you obviously should get one every time you go to Costco. It’s so cheap, you’re losing money if you don’t! While you’re at the food court, though, be sure to check out their latest offering: the <a href=#>Double Chocolate Chunk Cookie</a>. It’s served warm and gooey, with a crisp outer crust, so it’s not a nightmare to eat as you walk the aisles. Personally, I think this cookie is too good to share, so it’s the perfect thing to buy at Costco if you’re single.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BYlsFuwM5mma6xXZbBbq%2FOrKucp12es27Fzq6pnmWjnruouMRo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shantanu-maheshwari.html><span>←</span><span>Shantanu Maheshwari Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</span></a>
