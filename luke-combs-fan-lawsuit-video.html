A judge ordered her to pay $250,000 for the copyright infringement. As a part of the lawsuit, her Amazon storefront has been shut down, and all of her proceeds have been frozen. In the NBC WFLA interview, Nicol apologized to Luke and said: “I didn’t mean any harm. I’m a supporter of Luke Combs. I respect him, and this is not something I meant to go wrong like this. I just want to get back to my day-to-day life.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Luke was made aware of the situation and is taking action to make it right.

We do have a company that goes after folks—only, supposedly, large corporations operating internationally that make millions and millions of dollars making counterfeit T-shirts... Somehow, this woman Nicol has gotten wrapped up in this.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I was able to get Nicol’s phone number; I spoke to her this morning,” he continued. “She told me that she was absolutely shocked by this. I’m so apologetic. Talking to her, it makes me sick, honestly, that this would happen.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Luke told his fans that he is going to send Nicol $11,000—twice the amount of money frozen in her Amazon account—and he’s going to make his own tumbler and give the proceeds to Nicol, who has congestive heart failure. He also invited Nicole and her family to a show so he can give her a hug in person.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He said, “I was completely shocked when I saw this this morning.
