She performed "Who's Sorry Now" on American Bandstand, and it became an immediate hit. In 1974, Francis was the victim of a brutal rape in her hotel room. Her lawsuit led to improved security measures throughout the hotel industry. For years after she was assaulted, Francis didn't perform. She returned to the stage in the early 1990s and released an autobiography Who's Sorry Now, in 1984.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Singer and actress Connie Francis was born Concetta Franconero, on December 12, 1938 (some sources say 1937), in Newark, New Jersey. The daughter of George and Ida Franconero, Connie won first prize on Arthur Godfrey's Startime Talent Scouts television show at age 12, and performed on the show for four years. Godfrey convinced her to change her real last name to Francis after he had difficulty pronouncing it.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Music Career and Songs</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Francis signed with MGM Records in 1955 after she was rejected by nearly every major recording label. MGM released her first recording, "Freddy" because the president of MGM had a son named by the same name. During the next two years, she recorded a number of mediocre songs.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Francis was all set to quit music and study pre-med at NYU on scholarship when her father convinced her to record a decades-old tune, "Who's Sorry Now." Dick Clark introduced the song on his Bandstand TV show in 1958, and it became an immediate hit, selling a million copies less than six months after release. She started working with songwriters Neil Sedaka and Howie Greenfield, and recorded a string of hits, including "Stupid Cupid," "Lipstick on Your Collar," "Everybody's Somebody's Fool," "My Heart Has a Mind of Its Own" and "Don't Break the Heart That Loves You."</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Film Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Francis is primarily known for her singing career, but she played the lead in a number of films created for teenagers in the early 1960s. She starred in four motion pictures, Where the Boys Are (1960), Follow The Boys (1963), Looking For Love (1964) and When The Boys Meet The Girls (1965).</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Sexual Assault</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the late 1960s, Francis went to Vietnam to sing for the troops. Through the years, she has performed charity work for organizations such as UNICEF, the USO and CARE. Following a November 1974 performance at the Westbury Music Fair in Westbury, New York, Francis was the victim of a brutal rape and robbery after an intruder broke into her hotel room and held her at knifepoint.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">She won a lawsuit against the hotel for inadequate security, the result of which influenced the hotel and motel industry to install deadbolts, viewing ports and improved lighting. Francis was unable to sing for years after her attack, but slowly recovered until she was again able to tour in the early 1990s. Her autobiography, Who's Sorry Now, was released in 1984.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Personal Life and Spouse</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">She was married to first husband Dick Kanellis for just three months (1964-65) and to Joseph Garzilli from 1973 to 1978. She and Garzilli adopted one son.</p><ul data-node-id=20 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Francis</li><li>Birth Year: 1938</li><li>Birth date: December 12, 1938</li><li>Birth State: New Jersey</li><li>Birth City: Newark</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Female</li><li>Best Known For: Connie Francis was a pop music star in the 1950s and '60s and starred in a number of films aimed at the teen market.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Pop</li><li>Television</li><li>Drama</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Sagittarius</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=23><ul data-node-id=25 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Connie Francis Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/musicians/connie-francis</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: April 22, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGikrquZmLaiutJomqimnp6ybrLRmqWcoaM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-molly-martens-details-to-know-about.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Molly Martens?
