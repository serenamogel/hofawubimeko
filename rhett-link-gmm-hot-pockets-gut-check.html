If you love these little microwaveable hand pies but don’t want to risk suffering third-degree steam burns, you can live vicariously though Rhett & Link, who tasted every Hot Pockets flavor the crew could find on an October 2022 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">episode of Good Mythical Morning</a>. Spoiler alert: Hot Pockets are always at least a little bit good, no matter the flavor, but below we’ve listed the four R&L thought were the best of the best. (And, if you’re curious, here’s what the Sporked crew <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">has to say on the matter</a>.)</p><p class=has-small-font-size>The following article contains affiliate links that may generate a small commission to us when you make a purchase through the link.

The fact that they had already tried the standard Chicken Bacon Ranch Hot Pocket made this Big & Bold version a little less exciting, but it was still pretty great! This one has a ranch-blasted crust (hence the “bold” aspect), which makes it less photogenic, but the insides are the same as the regular CBR. Overall, a solid Hot Pocket experience.</p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pepperoni & Sausage Pizza (Garlic Buttery Crust)</a></strong><p>Link, a sausage-on-pizza guy, liked the flavor of the sausage in this Hot Pocket. (Side note: I find it hilarious that a guy named Link is a self-proclaimed sausage man.) Rhett, who generally enjoys the combo of sausage and pepperoni on pizza, loved both the pepperoni and the sausage in this Hot Pocket. Link tried this one a second time and said, “That’s good stuff,” while Rhett called it “really, really good.” His only complaint was that it kind of pushes into pizza roll territory, making it less unique than some of the other Hot Pocket flavors. It tasted great, but the more unique flavors had an edge, for sure.</p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Philly Steak & Cheese (Seasoned Crust)</a></strong><p>Unlike the cheese in some of the other steak Hot Pockets, the cheese in the Philly Steak & Cheese Hot Pocket had peppers and onions that Rhett said “really balance it out.” This one just got better the more they tasted it. Rhett decided that this one was way better than the Pepperoni & Sausage Pizza Hot Pocket, “no contest.” They both thought it tasted like a real Philly cheesesteak (no one tell Philadelphia; they will sue), and Link was very impressed with this one overall.</p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chicken Bacon Ranch (Crispy Buttery Crust)</a></strong><p>Rhett’s first reaction was: “I like that. I really like that.” Specifically, this Hot Pocket’s nice balance of flavors, the tanginess of the ranch, as well as the crispy, buttery crust. They both loved the filling and also liked the chive-y, buttery, outside, which is what ultimately put this one ahead of Big & Bold Chicken Bacon Ranch Hot Pocket in the ranking. This one became Rhett & Link’s pick for the best Hot Pocket on the market—or “the hottest pocket,” so to speak.</p><p><strong>Honorable Mentions: </strong>Link really liked the Italian-Style Meatballs & Mozzarella flavor so much he called it “bangin.” Rhett & Link also thought Big & Bold Buffalo Chicken was pretty good—not too spicy and decently flavorful. They also liked the Steak Nacho, as it was the most different from the other flavors, in a good way.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><a href=# class="lazy-load-youtube preview-lazyload preview-youtube" data-video-title="We Tried EVERY Hot Pocket Flavor" title='Play video "We Tried EVERY Hot Pocket Flavor"' rel=noopener>https://youtu.be/RjS2yIgn3IQ</a></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKqYmsG1ecuipaRll6K6brTOrWSpp5OgsrW%2FjKCsrWWTnbKkt44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./john-henry-foley-net-worth-244265.html><span>←</span><span>John Henry Foley Net Worth</span></a>
