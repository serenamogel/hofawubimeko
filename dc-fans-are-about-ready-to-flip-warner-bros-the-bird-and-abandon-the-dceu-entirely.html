Discovery, and fans have had enough.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=340 data-current-count=340 data-injectable=false>The DC Extended Universe has been dealt a particularly bad hand with its controversial cast and crew (think Joss Whedon, Jared Letto, Amber Heard, and most recently Ezra Miller), as well as backstage business and management chaos with the merger between Warner Bros. and Discovery bringing about extensive restructuring within the company.</p><p data-characters=334 data-current-count=674 data-injectable=true>The latest announcement that Batgirl, a movie which had already undergone production and was close to being ready for release, was going in the trash, has been the final straw for a lot of exasperated fans. The puzzling decision was reportedly <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">down to tax purposes with Warner Bros deciding the movie wasn’t financially viable</a>.</p><p data-characters=214 data-current-count=214 data-injectable=false>Many have questioned <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">why the company would cancel Batgirl, when The Flash is still standing regardless of titular actor Ezra Miller’s increasingly strange behavior,</a> which has made headlines across the board.</p><p data-characters=472 data-current-count=686 data-injectable=true>The discontent is widespread with users taking to social media to express their frustrations, like one Redditor claiming to be “tired of giving a sh-t about this never ending clusterf-ck of a film franchise.” The post continues, saying “I’m pretty much done and I’m just going back to enjoying the comic books and animated shows. F-ck the DCEU and what it’s done to almost a century of DC comics legacy and the fans that love it.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>I’m just tired.</a> from <a href=#>DC_Cinematic</a></figure><p data-characters=173 data-current-count=473 data-injectable=true>The comments section seems to be on the same page, with the most upvoted comment expressing in all caps, with some profanities in the mix, how much it sucks being a DC fan.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>PaulEDangerously’s comment from discussion "I’m just tired."</a>.</figure><p data-characters=385 data-current-count=685 data-injectable=true>Others were quick to dispute this particular rant by pointing out that, outside of the DCEU, there is still plenty of great DC content to be enjoyed. However, Warner Bros. Discovery’s recent unpredictable business movements have DC aficionados nervous that even the Comics’ department might suffer, especially since it seems to have lost some of its biggest names already.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>phargoh’s comment from discussion "I’m just tired."</a>.</figure><p data-characters=289 data-current-count=589 data-injectable=true>One of the biggest successes DC Entertainment has enjoyed in recent years, by staying miles away from the DCEU, was The Batman, starring Robert Pattinson and directed by Matt Reeves. Much like Bruce to the people of Gotham, the movie stands now as a beacon of light for desperate DC fans.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>betterdayz02’s comment from discussion "I’m just tired."</a>.</figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>happybuffalowing’s comment from discussion "I’m just tired."</a>.</figure><p data-characters=448 data-current-count=448 data-injectable=true>David Zaslav is getting most of the heat as the recently appointed chief executive officer and president of Warner Bros. Discovery, after the merger with Discovery, Inc., which he previously presided over. Fans seem to think the future of the DCEU isn’t a priority for Zaslav, even arguing that “It honestly feels like he’s throwing not just DC but all of Warner Bros and HBOMax under the bus in order to pump up Discovery.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>ReturnOfDaSnack420’s comment from discussion "I’m just tired."</a>.</figure><p data-characters=162 data-current-count=462 data-injectable=true>One user perfectly summarized everything that has gone wrong with the DCEU and why the only option might be to “scrap the whole thing and start over.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>Jeeperdeep’s comment from discussion "I’m just tired."</a>.</figure><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=510 data-injectable=false>Time will tell if the DCEU is somehow able to turn this dire situation around.

Fury of the Gods, expected in October and December, respectively.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8OcZJ%2BZnqh6or7EZpibp6WperOxwJ2wZqyfYrOttc9mrpqqnpq%2Fbq7RqKpmrJiaeqO10Z1kmqaUYq6jrc2dpqdlpJ2ybrDCnqxmnZ6ptrOxy7Jm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brooklyn-sims-dies-in-alabama-shooting-escambia-county-home-depot.html><span>←</span><span>Brooklyn Sims Dies in Alabama Shooting, Escambia County Home Depot</span></a>
