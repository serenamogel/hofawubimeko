Although the 61-year-old hasn’t given a public explanation for the about-face, he has provided plenty of hints as to why he might be particularly picky about his next picture.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Known for movies like Pulp Fiction (1994), Inglorious Basterds (2009), and most recently, Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood (2019), Tarantino has frequently affirmed he plans to retire after making 10 movies—citing his ultimate <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/quentin-tarantino-movie-critic-what-happened-1235879479/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="goal of “going out on top.”" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">goal of “going out on top.”</a> However, his plan isn’t as cut-and-dry as it might appear.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Read His Biography</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 emevuu60">Why does Tarantino only want to make 10 movies?<br></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Tarantino has spoken extensively about his plans to retire, explaining that he doesn’t want to tarnish his legacy by making films with “diminishing returns” late in his career. He has cited directors from the “Golden Age” of Hollywood, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://ew.com/article/2015/12/22/quentin-tarantino-future-children-10-movies/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="such as Billy Wilder and his 1981 comedy flop Buddy Buddy" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">such as Billy Wilder and his 1981 comedy flop Buddy Buddy</a>, as examples of people he doesn’t wish to emulate until the very end.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Most directors have horrible last movies. Usually, their worst movies are their last movies,” Tarantino <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3NPXclrvBRCVn7sNx5pWJn?si=Mqu_7qkFTeOhwcn2j0nXbA&nd=1" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="explained on the Pure Cinema Podcast in June 2021" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">explained on the Pure Cinema Podcast in June 2021</a>. “So, to actually end your career on a decent movie is rare. To end it with, like, a good movie is kind of phenomenal.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Still, settling on a 10-film limit appears to have been somewhat arbitrary. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/steven-spielberg data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Steven Spielberg" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">Steven Spielberg</a> (Schindler’s List and Saving Private Ryan) and, more recently, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/christopher-nolan data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Christopher Nolan" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">Christopher Nolan</a> (<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/scientists/j-robert-oppenheimer data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Oppenheimer class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">Oppenheimer</a>) each won Academy Awards for Best Director beyond their 10th films. (Tarantino has competed for that coveted Oscar three times and won twice in writing categories.) The Pulp Fiction director <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://deadline.com/2014/11/quentin-tarantino-retirement-hateful-eight-international-release-1201280583/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="has even admitted" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">has even admitted</a> that if the right project comes along after No. 10, “I won’t not do it just because I said I wouldn’t.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A more logical explanation for the retirement talk is Tarantino’s age. His first movie, Reservoir Dogs, debuted in 1992, and he has said he feels it’s “time to wrap up the show” after more than three decades of filmmaking. “I’m an entertainer: I want to leave you wanting more and not just work,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://edition.cnn.com/videos/entertainment/2022/11/18/quentin-tarantino-final-film-wallace-wtcw-sot-vpx-cprog.cnn data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="he explained to CNN reporter Chris Wallace" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">he explained to CNN reporter Chris Wallace</a> in 2022. “I don’t want to become this old man who’s out of touch, when already I’m feeling a bit like an old man out of touch when it comes to the current movies that are out right now.”</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">More Famous Movie Directors</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 emevuu60">How many movies has Tarantino directed?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">By his own measure, Tarantino has directed nine feature-length movies and expects to lead only one more. However, this tally includes a few caveats.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Most notably, Tarantino counts his two Kill Bill movies, starring <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/uma-thurman data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Uma Thurman" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">Uma Thurman</a>, as one film broken into two parts. Volume 1 released in 2003 followed by volume 2 the next year. If you count each volume as its own release, Tarantino is already at 10.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Tarantino is also credited with directing a segment from the 1995 anthology film Four Rooms, and he served as a guest director for one scene of the 2005 crime thriller Sin City.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Add in writing and producing credits for films like 1996’s From Dusk till Dawn, in which he appears onscreen alongside <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/george-clooney data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="George Clooney" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">George Clooney</a>, and 2007’s Grindhouse: Planet Terror, and Tarantino is well into the double digits.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 emevuu60">Has Tarantino passed on other projects besides The Movie Critic?</h2><img alt="quentin tarantino standing on a red carpet and clasping his hands" title="Director Quentin Tarantino at Rome Film Fest" width=1024 height=682 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/american-director-quentin-tarantino-at-rome-film-fest-2021-news-photo-1713991403.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Quentin Tarantino appears at the Rome Film Fest in October 2021.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Yes, including a follow-up to the beloved Kill Bill films.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://deadline.com/2023/07/quentin-tarantino-shoots-down-hopes-kill-bill-vol-3-1235429682/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Thurman revealed in 2022" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">Thurman revealed in 2022</a> there had been discussions and “real thought” about Kill Bill: Volume 3. But Tarantino killed any buzz about a potential sequel a year later, simply saying, “I don’t see that.” Although given his stance regarding volumes 1 and 2, a third movie likely wouldn’t have counted toward his total anyway.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">More intriguingly, Tarantino was apparently close to directing a gritty, R-rated sequel in the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/chris-pine data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Chris Pine" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">Chris Pine</a>–led Star Trek series that began back in 2009. In a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://collider.com/quentin-tarantino-star-trek-movie-hard-r/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="December 2023 interview with Collider" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">December 2023 interview with Collider</a>, screenwriter Mark L. Smith revealed he had discussions with Tarantino about the movie but that the director couldn’t get past the idea of a Star Trek sequel being his last project.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It’s just one of those that I can’t ever see happening,” said Smith, who also claimed Tarantino still had the script on his desk. “But it would be the greatest Star Trek film, not for my writing, but just for what Tarantino was gonna do with it. It was just a balls-out kind of thing.”</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 emevuu60">So what will Tarantino’s last movie be?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">All we know for now is that, apparently, it won’t be The Movie Critic.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://deadline.com/2024/04/quentin-tarantino-final-film-wont-be-the-movie-critic-scrapped-1235888577/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Deadline reported" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">Deadline reported</a> on April 17 that Tarantino simply had “a change of heart” and moved on from the film, which was expected to star Tarantino’s past collaborator <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/brad-pitt data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Brad Pitt" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">Brad Pitt</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">However, we can’t rule out that Tarantino might revisit the movie similar to The Hateful Eight. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2rp5zy0pgo data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="According to the BBC" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">According to the BBC</a>, he initially scrapped plans for that film after an actor shared a copy of the script, which subsequently leaked online. But after a table reading for charity drew immense praise, he returned to the project. Starring <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/samuel-l-jackson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Samuel L.

I trust my process,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/quentin-tarantino-movie-critic-what-happened-1235879479/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tarantino said in 2016" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">Tarantino said in 2016</a>. “Not every film needs to be made.
