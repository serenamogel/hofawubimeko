<a href=../../../the-nzxt-c650-650w-psu-review.html></a>
NZXT is a company that has come from fairly humble origins, starting things off back in 2004 with just a couple of PC cases. They have come a long way since then, slowly by surely expanding their ever-growing product portfolio. Nowadays, NZXT is one of the most prominent PC case, cooling, and power supply manufacturers, with a very strong global market presence.

John Cusack spends a lot of time on Twitter, where his bio states he's an "apocalyptic s**t disturber." In April 2020, his latest "disturbance," if you will, involved dubious claims about 5G, the high-speed cellular data network. In the since-deleted tweets (via&nbsp;Geo News), Cusack wrote, "5 – G wil [sic] be proven to be very very bad for people's health. I got sources in scientific community – and medical."

The announcements this year from Samsung are notably muted without the launch of a new Galaxy smartphone, but despite this being a mobile-focused conference in Barcelona this week, there were a few new Samsung devices to whet the appetite.

Two years ago Samsung dropped the bomb by releasing the first TLC NAND based SSD. I still vividly remember Anand's reaction when I told him about the SSD 840. I was in Korea for the launch event and was sitting in a press room where Samsung held the announcement. Samsung had only sampled us and everyone else with the 840 Pro, so the 840 and its guts had remained as a mystery.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Sean Giambrone Net Worth</h2><time>Jul 24, 2024</time>
