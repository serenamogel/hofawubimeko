Relationship</span></h2><p>Various erroneous legends say that the actor claimed to be gay. Most of the rumors, however, were unfounded because Zach is 100 percent straight.</p><p>The idea is based on his portrayal of a guy in the 2009 film Dare who is drawn to his girlfriend’s homosexual best buddy.</p><p>On December 12, 2012, Zach wed the stunning Kiele Sanchez, making him the luckiest guy alive. In Napa, California, in front of their loved ones, the couple was wed in a small, private ceremony.</p><p>Since their initial intense love affair in 2010, the two have remained together. They must be quite grateful to The Matadors for connecting them. They got married a month after Zach proposed to her in November of that same year.</p><p>The good news that Zach and Kiele were expecting a child arrived in August 2015. Because Kiele miscarried at a late stage of pregnancy, their gorgeous kid was unable to see the sun. Two years later, the couple used surrogacy to give birth to a beautiful daughter.</p><h2><span id=How_tall_is_Zach_Gilford_Weight_Hair_Color>How tall is Zach Gilford?
