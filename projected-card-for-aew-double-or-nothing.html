There have already been several exciting matches announced for the event. AEW has been building to more as the show continues to draw closer.</p><p>There are currently three bouts set in stone for Double or Nothing<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">. CM Punk will challenge “Hangman” Adam Page</a> for the AEW World Championship. Thunder Rosa will <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">defend the AEW Women’s World Championship</a> against Serena Deeb. Wardlow will attempt to wrestle his way out of his contract with MJF in a major grudge match.</p><p>The show is just weeks away, so there is a pretty clear picture of how Tony Khan wants to book the rest of the matches. In the latest <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wrestling Observer Newsletter</a>, Dave Meltzer gave a full rundown on how he believes Double or Nothing will look when the card is finalized. It looks like it is going to be an stacked PPV.</p><p>“The Double or Nothing PPV at this point is Page vs. Punk for the AEW title, Thunder Rosa vs. Serena Deeb for the women’s title, MJF vs. Wardlow and if Wardlow wins, he gets out of his contract, but if he loses, he can never sign a contract with AEW. Those stips in theory indicate Wardlow has to win, because I’m not sure that a Midnight Wardlow angle would be smart right now. Plus you’ve got the two tournament finals.</p><p>Based on stuff teased, it now looks like a three-way for the tag title with Jungle Boy & Luchasaurus vs. Keith Lee & Swerve Strickland vs. Ricky Starks & Powerhouse Hobbs, Death Triangle vs. House of Black, Hardys vs. Young Bucks, Jericho Appreciation Society vs. Santana & Ortiz & Eddie Kingston & Jon Moxley & Bryan Danielson, something involving Scorpio Sky and Sammy Guevara in singles or tag and Samoa Joe vs. Jay Lethal for the ROH TV title. They’ve also announced Hook & Danhausen vs. Tony Nese & Mark Sterling as a pre-show match.”</p><p>The two Owen Hart tournament finals matchups won’t be known until after the semi-finals. Everything else has been being built up on Dynamite and Rampage. If this is how Double or Nothing’s card ultimately looks, fans should be in for a huge treat.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p><strong>What do you think of this story?
