As the announcement was made so late in 2023, it is unlikely that the movie will be released by early 2024. However, fans can still hold out hope for a late 2024 or early 2025 release. In the meantime, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">we’ve been binging some similar anime</a> to keep us going until we’re reunited with Cid, Aurora, and the gang.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The cast</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/the-eminence-in-shadow.jpg><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=682 data-injectable=true>As the plot of Lost Echoes is not yet known, it’s difficult to guess which of the characters will be present, and which will be absent. However, assuming that the movie follows from where the second season ended, then fans can expect to hear many familiar voices. If the movie isn’t canon, we’ll probably be seeing some new faces. Either way, it’s going to be a win-win.</p><p data-characters=312 data-current-count=312 data-injectable=false>Seiichiro Yamashita voices Cid Kageno, the overpowered leader of the Shadow Garden organization. Alongside him, the principal cast of the show includes Asami Seto as Alpha, Inori Minse as Beta, Suzuko Mimori as Gamme, Fairouz Ai as Delta, Kana Hanazawa as Alexia Midgar and Haruka Shiraishi as Rose Oriana.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-the-eminence-in-shadow-lost-echoes-plot data-injectable=false>The Eminence in Shadow: Lost Echoes plot</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-Eminence-In-Shadow-Season-2.jpg><p data-characters=218 data-current-count=218 data-injectable=false>Fans have since speculated on what the plot of The Eminence in Shadow: Lost Echoes will be, specifically, whether the movie will feature an adaptation of an arc from the manga, or we’ll be fed some original content.</p><p data-characters=413 data-current-count=631 data-injectable=false>Based on the poster released after the second season, we may follow Cid as he explores a decimated Japan in the Lost Echoes movie. As it stands, all fingers point to the movie directly following the events of the second season’s finale. Where most isekai shows rarely show their protagonists returning to their former lives, Lost Echoes may break the mold with this plot, giving fans a lot to look forward to.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6tn55llaK2r7HNnJxmoZ5iwKmtw6iuZqSfqMFuscKhpp6rXaK8t7XEZqmepJWWwKZ51qKlnaenYrCiv9Nmp6WnpGKur7CMpqarnV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./limoncello-cake.html><span>←</span><span>Limoncello Cake Recipe (Super moist!)</span></a>
