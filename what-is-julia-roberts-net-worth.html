After toying with you by outbidding you a dollar at a time for hours – maybe days – she could land a killing blow, offering more money than you make in a year, then spend the evening performing a live streamed reading of your adolescent fantasies set against a 19th century mahogany fireplace to millions of rapt hangers-on.</p><p data-characters=68 data-current-count=68 data-injectable=false>I’m not saying that she would do any of this, only that she could.</p><p data-characters=359 data-current-count=427 data-injectable=true>That’s because Julia Roberts’ net worth – according to the estimates of the people at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, who really do put a lot of time into thinking about these things – is a full quarter of a billion dollars. $250 million. That’s nearly $100 million more than Danny Ocean set out to steal in Ocean’s 11, and Roberts never even went to prison.</p><h2 id=h-how-julia-roberts-made-more-money-than-you data-injectable=false>How Julia Roberts made more money than you</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Julia Roberts (@juliaroberts)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=547 data-current-count=847 data-injectable=true>Helpfully, she made her money by starring in movies about heists instead of carrying them out. From humble beginnings she amassed her fortune, beginning with a scant $50,000 payday for 1988’s Mystic Pizza. Two years later, she commanded half a million for Pretty Woman. The year after that, $7 million for Hook.&nbsp;The hits just kept on coming, and Roberts was soon collecting eight-figure paychecks plus a cut of the gross in some of the biggest pictures coming out of Hollywood. She also made <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Flatliners</a>, which is strange to think about now.</p><p data-characters=470 data-current-count=470 data-injectable=true>Of note, Mona Lisa Smile netted her $25 million, and a five-year contract with Lancome cosmetics in 2010 made her a further $50 million. She has purchased and sold over $50 million in real estate over the course of her career, and insured her own mouth for $30 million in 2012. You, meanwhile, wore boxer shorts with worn-out elastic while you ate a toaster pastry for dinner last night, and canceled your Apple TV Plus subscription when the monthly price jumped to $9.</p><p data-characters=117 data-current-count=117 data-injectable=false>Or maybe I’m projecting.
