Still, the album is comprised of remastered songs from the 2014 album of the same name, as well as new songs <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“from the vault,”</a> as Taylor likes to label them, written and ideated when she was first making 1989 in the early 2010s.</p><p data-characters=643 data-current-count=643 data-injectable=true>A brand new album of never-before-heard originals is coming out in April of 2024 titled <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Tortured Poets Department.</a> Everything Taylor has revealed about the album — from calling it a “lifeline” during hard times, to the tracklist and teasers — indicates we’re in for a devastatingly beautiful breakup album, born from the complicated feelings of terminating a six-year relationship with the guy that once inspired love declarations like those in “Daylight,” “Call It What You Want,” “Invisible String,” and “New Year’s Day” (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and the list goes on, and on</a>).</p><p data-characters=505 data-current-count=505 data-injectable=true>That’s not to say the record-breaking Grammy winner didn’t figure out a way to squeeze in a last-minute song inspired by her newfound romance with Travis Kelce. After all, Taylor did say the album was written over the last two years, including the time she has spent <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">touring the world</a> since the Eras Tour began in March of 2023. Taylor and Travis’ love story started when the football player attended a concert at his team the Kansas City Chiefs’ home stadium, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Arrowhead</a>, in July.</p><p data-characters=143 data-current-count=143 data-injectable=false>We will only know for sure whether The Tortured Poets Department contains a cheeky Travis-inspired song when the album drops on April 19, 2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZaSWxq270WaqsKGWqcBuusSwZKynnpx6p7vRZqurmaaewG63xKWanmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jane-curtin-net-worth-154051.html><span>←</span><span>Jane Curtin Net Worth</span></a>
