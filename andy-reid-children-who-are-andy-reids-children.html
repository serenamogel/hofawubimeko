He intended to transfer to Stanford but damaged his knee.</p><p>Randy Tidwell is Reid’s teammate and best buddy, and BYU head coach LaVell Edwards sought him out and added him to the squad in an effort to encourage Tidwell to enroll at BYU.</p><p>Reid played on the same BYU squad as Tom Holmoe and Jim McMahon. Reid’s teammates remarked that while he didn’t play much, he was highly analytical and paid great attention to Doug Scovil, the offensive coordinator, and Edwards. His senior year, BYU took home the Holiday Bowl victory.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/08101933/download-1024x683.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Andy Reid career</h2><p>Reid started his coaching career as an offensive assistant with the Green Bay Packers, where he worked from 1992 to 1998 and won the Super Bowl in Super Bowl XXXI.</p><p>With the Eagles, when he served as head coach for the first time in 1999, they consistently advanced to the postseason.</p><p>Reid guided the Eagles to nine postseason appearances, six division titles, five NFC Championship Games (including four straight from 2001 to 2004), and a loss to the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XXXIX.</p><p>Reid had a history of success, but the Eagles lost ground and missed the playoffs in 2011 and 2012, which resulted in his firing from Philadelphia.</p><p>In 2013, Reid was instantly appointed head coach of the Chiefs, where he successfully turned around the team’s dire situation.</p><p>He assisted in breaking the 1993–2004 playoff losing run of eight games.
