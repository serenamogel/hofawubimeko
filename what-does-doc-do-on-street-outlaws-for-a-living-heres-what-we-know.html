He modified his Street Beast to provide the best performance on the race tracks, as well as its ability and control over the aerodynamics of the vehicle.&nbsp;He’s done very well doing what he loves the most and he can’t seem to stop his dominance over the race.</span></p><p><span>Coming to the question of what Doc does for a living, he has a lot to do in furthering his career and being a father to his family members.&nbsp;In the world of street racing and probably every other racing sport, drivers see it as a full time job and most don’t do anything else outside of training and racing.&nbsp;Most guys in&nbsp;</span><span>Off-the-Street</span><span>&nbsp;actually quit their full-time jobs, but that’s not the same for Doc.</span></p><p><span>He has a repair shop that he started with his grandfather several years ago and still works there because it’s something special for him and not just a business.&nbsp;So basically what he does for a living is he’s an&nbsp;</span><span>off-the-street</span><span>&nbsp;racing driver as well as an auto mechanic.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYlsFusM6eqmacn5h6pbuMqKVmq6SnsqbAjKisraSRrMBuss6rZJplnJ7DqrrGZp%2BeqpWoeri0wK1ksJ1doLuww44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nvidia-releases-39882-whql-game-ready-driver.html><span>←</span><span>NVIDIA Releases 398.82 WHQL Game Ready Driver</span></a>
