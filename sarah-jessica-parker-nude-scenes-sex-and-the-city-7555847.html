I never had any judgments about anybody else doing it, it wasn’t like a morality thing … I was shy.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Aside from just going nude, the actress revealed that she also had strong feelings about any risqué language that the SATC characters used.&nbsp;“We were on HBO, and I knew that meant we could say anything we wanted, and we could be loose, and liberal, and salty, and ribald,” she said. “But I also thought therefore it meant we had to be disciplined, and we shouldn’t just use language because we could.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sarah Jessica then added that, as always, her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>main goal was to stay true to Carrie’s personality</a>. “Carrie Bradshaw’s a writer, and she’s really, really, really thoughtful about what she says, how she says it, when she says it, who’s she saying it to, and if we want to use language, let’s be really thoughtful about when she uses it, we can be smart about it,” she shared.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570pqpmqBdn7K0v8icmGaokae4pr6Mp6ydnV2osKa6xKxkrJ2oYq6vsIytn55lk57BunmWbmxucGRs</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./neuromuscular-junction.html><span>←</span><span>Neuromuscular Junction Quiz</span></a>
