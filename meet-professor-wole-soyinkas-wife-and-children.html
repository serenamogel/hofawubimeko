With over 50 pieces of work, he was the first Nigerian to be awarded the Noble Prize for Literature for his prowess in the field. He is also known for his outstanding efforts in the history of Nigerian politics, fight with British colonization, corrupt leadership in Nigeria and Africa as a whole. Asides from these, Professor Wole Soyinka’s wife and children are other important aspects of him that everyone should know.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-many-times-has-wole-soyinka-been-married></span><strong>How Many Times Has Wole Soyinka Been Married?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Professor Wole Soyinka has not had it rosy when it comes to marriage. He has been reportedly married to three women with whom he shares children. Below are the women he has been married to and his present wife:</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=his-first-mariage-was-to-a-british-writer></span><strong>His First Mariage was to a British Writer</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The first love story of the literature guru was with British writer Barbara Dixton. The duo met at the University of Leeds in the 1950s and got married in 1958 while Wole Soyinka was still a student. After five years of marriage, their marriage started experiencing a hard time, leading to a divorce. The first wife of the professor died sometime in the 2000s. The duo had a son before they divorced.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=his-second-marriage-was-to-olaide-idowu></span><strong>His Second Marriage was to Olaide Idowu</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The literature icon got married for the second time to Olaide Idowu in 1963. The wedding was an extravagant affair that was graced by dignitaries from Nigeria. Olaide was a librarian at Ogun State University at the time of marriage. Professor Wole Soyinka’s marriage to her lasted for about ten years before coming to an end. Their union produced three daughters and a son, but one of the daughters died in 2013 after an undisclosed illness.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-wole-soyinkas-wife></span><strong>Who is Wole Soyinka’s wife?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Professor Wole Soyinka’s current wife is Folake Doherty Soyinka, whom he married in 1989.

After completing NYSC, she secured a job at the Guardian, where Professor Wole Soyinka met her again and they kicked off their relationship. However, her relationship wasn’t rosy as her parents were not in support because of the fame and success that was attributed to Professor Wole Soyinka as of then.</p><p>Though Folake’s parents did not support the relationship, her brothers and sisters stood by her because her happiness mattered to them. Despite all these, the love birds still got married. A few months after their marriage, her parents grew to love the professor till their death.
