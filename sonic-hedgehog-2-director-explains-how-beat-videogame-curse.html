Because I think all movies are about character no matter where they come from. Whether it’s a comic book, a video game, a novel or whatever, I think you really have to approach it like, ‘what’s a great story, what’s a great character story?’ If someone is sitting in that theater and knows nothing about the video game, are they still going to have a great time, are they still going to be invested in this character and this story? That was our approach.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=334 data-current-count=634 data-injectable=true>Fowler commented on his creative philosophy on the project during an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">interview with Fandom</a> published earlier today. He also said one thing key to making the rapidly moving mammal work on screen was retaining the spirit of the characters countless people have come to know and love through their decades spent in various game entries.</p><p>“It’s extremely important to make sure that you retain the spirit of the video games and the video game characters because, first and foremost, the fanbase – they’re the ones that are really going to be in your corner if you can do that; if you can bring the characters that they’ve loved from the games to life on the big screen.”</p><p data-characters=41 data-current-count=410 data-injectable=false>Sonic the Hedgehog 2 opens Friday April 8</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoqqimmZh6qbHDoJyhp5dif26wyKucnKyfp3qmxM%2BlmKKmo2K1sMOMm5yarF2rtqWxzqCYpp1dmMKzv8Ro</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./apple-announces-watchos-2.html><span>←</span><span>Apple Announces watchOS 2</span></a>
