The cereal brand known for being “magically delicious” (and more recently for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">facing an FDA investigation</a>) is really leaning into the “magic” this summer: For a limited time only, Lucky Charms is selling <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Magic Gems</a> cereal.</p><p>Although when it comes to Lucky Charms, I didn’t need to put the word “magic” in quotes. I think we all remember that feeling of being six years old at a hotel with a continental breakfast, having a rare moment of agency in our food choices, and finally getting to try Lucky Charms for the first time. That feeling can only be described as literally magic and no, I will not be taking questions at this time.</p><p>So what exactly are Lucky Charms Magic Gems? As far as I can tell, they’re just normal Lucky Charms but with the addition of another kind of marshmallow: “the magic gem.” I thought for sure with a name like that there was going to be edible glitter involved (a favorite of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sporked staff writer Jordan Myrick</a>) and I got pretty excited. Turns out, however, these large white marshmallow “gemstones” are <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">apparently</a> covered in “bright, colorful sugar” that looks sparkly, not edible glitter. That’s a little bit of a letdown, to be honest. I’ve always wanted to eat enough of a sparkly food that it would make *cough* everything sparkle, if you know what I’m saying.</p><p>But I guess this new Lucky Charms cereal is not going to fulfill that particular dream for me.&nbsp;No sparkle, just more sugar. I want to be clear: I’m in no way miffed about the additional sugar, just the apparent lack of edible sparkles. But in the interest of making sure my research is thorough, I may have to buy some of this new cereal just to make absolute sure.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKSlmLi6ecKhmKulo2K6orPInGSgnZ2oeq%2Bx1mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./intolerable-cruelty-2003.html><span>←</span><span>Intolerable Cruelty movie review (2003)</span></a>
