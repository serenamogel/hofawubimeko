His limelight got even brighter with his lead role in the hit trilogy, The Maze Runner (2014-2018). Since then, he has had a regular appearance in different films such as Deepwater Horizon (2016), American Assassin (2017), and Bumblebee (2018), among others.

Below is a list of the women Dylan O’Brien has been romantically linked to in the past.</p><h3><strong>Britt Robertson (2012 – 2018)</strong></h3><p>Britt is perhaps the earliest person linked with Dylan O’Brien as far as his known dating history goes. This is because he wasn’t too much of a known figure until 2011 with his role in Teen Wolf. Dylan and Britt met in 2012. They first got acquainted with each other in 2012 on the set of The First Time, a romantic comedy film. In it, Dylan played the role of the male lead, a high school senior. Britt Robertson played Aubrey Miller, whom Dylan’s portrayed character falls in love with.</p><p>Turns out the love seeped out of the camera and screens onto real life, and the two dated for six years! They reportedly split in 2018 silently. Fans didn’t even know until they began to spot the former love birds with other people. Britt was seen hanging out with the actor Graham Rogers, and Dylan, sometime after, with Chloë Grace Moretz.</p><p>It isn’t exactly known why the pair called it quits when they did after such a long time together. One of the things we could scoop out, however, is that a source revealed Britt Robertson didn’t like being seen with Dylan, saying it made her nervous. It was also reported that the two had already begun seeing other people before their official split.</p><h3><strong>Chloë Grace Moretz (Rumored)&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Chloë Grace Moretz is an actress who started stamping a solid career repute and bagging accolades in the film industry from an early age. She’s already had four MTV Movie & TV Awards, a couple of People’s Choice Awards, and two Young Artist Awards, among others.<br>She’s made remarkable appearances in different movies and series, though she is best recognized for her role as Hit-Girl in the 2010 superhero movie Kick-Ass.</p><p>She was just 13 at the time the film was released, but that helps you understand why she’s been visible enough to have been Dylan O’Brien’s celebrity crush seven years before the pair started sparkling dating rumors. Dylan affirmed his crush on Chloë in an interview with Hollywire back in 2011. He retracted this affirmation after finding out she was just 14 at the time, and he was 19.</p><p>Looks like the feelings still glimmered inside after all those years. After the breakup with Britt Robertson, Dylan O’Brien and Chloë Grace were spotted on a few outings together, warm-heartedly, but nothing so obvious to make a conclusion. A source revealed to US Weekly magazine that Dylan and Chloë had maintained a friendship over time, but avoided being seen together to keep off unneeded public attention.</p><p>Sadly for those who must have shipped the pair, their supposed romantic relationship never went beyond the mists of being just rumors.</p><h3><strong>Did Dylan O’Brien Ever Date Sarah Ramos?</strong></h3><p>Dylan O’Brien and Sarah Ramos who were once the subject of dating rumors have never been in a romantic relationship. The two first met during the filming of Love and Monsters (2020). They became friends during the quarantine period of that crazy year (2020). Dylan and Sarah recreated popular movie scenes with other actors and dropped them on Twitter for their fans.</p><p>In the month of May, they decided to remake a famous flirty scene from David Fincher’s movie, The Social Network. The 85 seconds-long video went viral online, gaining over 2.4 million views, and also got the attention and approval of The Social Network star, Andrew Garfield. Due to the awesome chemistry between the duo in the parody, fans began to speculate that Dylan and Sarah were dating.</p><p>That turned out to be fan fiction, however, as Sarah announced in December 2020 that she had gotten married to director Matt Spicer, who she had been in a relationship with since 2013. They got married in October 2020. Dylan also revealed later that they shot the video from different locations, and he annoyed Sarah with the many takes he sent to get it right.</p><p>In all, Dylan O’Brien hasn’t been too vocal about his love life through the years. His silence has often left fans to their own thoughts and speculations, whenever his interactions with other personalities are seen as a hint.</p><h2><strong>Chloe Bennet (Rumored – June 2022)</strong></h2><p>Dylan O’Brien and Chloe Bennet sparked dating rumors in June 2022 after they were spotted grabbing lunch in Los Angeles. The lunch was described as a relaxed affair in which both parties were quite comfortable with each other. Patrons who were also there at the time confirmed that it was also quite a flirty one.</p><p>The lunch date made the headlines in several online news articles, but nothing more was heard about the duo. Therefore, it is possible that Dylan O’Brien and Chloe Bennet briefly dated. It is also possible that the “date” was simply a case of two friends grabbing lunch.</p><h2><strong>Sabrina Carpenter (Rumored – September 2022)</strong></h2><p>Sabrina Carpenter is an American singer and actress who is famous for her works on Disney Channel productions such as Girl Meets World and Adventures in Babysitting.</p><p>Carpenter and O’Brien were seen in New York in September 2022, with multiple reports claiming that they were kissing when they were spotted together. The duo never came out to confirm that they were dating or into any serious relationship, and whatever it was between them later fizzled out.</p><h2><strong>Rachael Lange (Rumored – January 2023)</strong></h2><p>In early January 2023, Dylan O’Brien and model Rachael Lange were seen holding hands together at the Paris Fashion Week, and as usual, there were rumors that they were dating each other. The story shed a lot of spotlight on Lange, and people soon started digging into her background. Unfortunately, they discovered several of her unsavory past tweets, including some that were racist.</p><p>This led to a controversy, and Lange’s rumored romance with Dylan took a backstage as she fought to save her career. She apologized for her past tweets and stated that there was no excuse for them. Following that whole controversy, nothing more was heard about her and O’Brien.</p><h2><strong>What Has Dylan O’Brien Said About His Dating Life?</strong></h2><p>Dylan O’Brien has revealed that he loves dating girls who have a <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">sense of humor</a> and are fun, cool, interesting, and quirky. For the actor, it doesn’t matter if the lady is a slim, tall model or a short brunette; the most important thing is that sense of humor. Dylan has maintained that it is all about personality for him, no matter how cliché it may sound.</p><p>Dylan O’Brien dropped this little nugget back in 2011 and, since then, has rarely spoken about his love life despite the public fascination with it. One cannot blame him, though. He has a busy career and has had to deal with the injuries he suffered while filming in 2016.</p><h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><h4><strong>Is Dylan O’Brien Dating Anyone?</strong></h4><p>Dylan O’Brien is not dating anyone right now, to the best of public knowledge.
