Lee is the oldest kid, having a younger brother two years his junior and a younger sister almost five years his junior.&nbsp;He said in an interview with Estar Entertainment that his younger siblings are more mature than him since he is more reliant on his mother. Jong-suk was a bashful child who surprised his mother when he grew up to become an actor. She couldn’t leave him alone because he would scream uncontrollably when she wasn’t there.&nbsp;As a youngster, his father was quite severe with him, and he was forced to practice taekwondo, among other things, and he eventually earned a black belt.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=more-about-lee-jong-suks-childhood-and-background></span>More about Lee Jong Suk’s Childhood and Background<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After attending a performing arts school, Lee Jong-Suk moved out of his parent’s house and lived alone in Seoul throughout high school.
