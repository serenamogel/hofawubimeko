Some individuals adore it, while others avoid it at all costs. Tattoos on a person’s body, in any case, do not go undetected.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Over the years, he has dedicated his body to many exquisite creations, which he proudly displays on his magnificent physique.</strong></p><p><strong>Viewers have questioned if the big tattoos displayed on the screen are real or phony. To dispel any suspicions, all markings visible on him are genuine and have a kind significance.</strong></p><p><strong>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>How Does Katie George, An ESPN Sporyscaster, Get Paid?</a></strong></p><h2>Tattoos by Omari Hardwick and Their Meanings</h2><p>Omari Hardwick has 22 tattoos on his body, not one, not two, but 22!</p><p>His most noticeable feature is a pair of angel wings that run across his back and down to his chest. His chest wings also contain a cross at the apex, which represents his religious convictions. Omari has also related this design to the popular character James ‘Ghost’ St. Patrick from ‘Power.’</p><p>Angel wings indicate a conviction, sovereignty, emancipation, and security, according to Body Art Guru, but an angel wing with a cross at the tip represents a near-death experience or the death of a loved one.</p><p>This tattoo is well-known among his followers, and they even refer to it as the <strong>“Ghost”</strong> tattoo because it is the one that is clearly visible on the show.</p><p>He had to spend hours in the makeup chair getting all other designs covered up, which is why we don’t see much of his other tatts on the screen.</p><figure id=attachment_1439152 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-1439152 style=width:650px class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding=async src alt="Omari Hardwick" width=650 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Omari Hardwick shows off his body tattoos (Source: Pinterest)</strong></figure><p>Furthermore, Hardwick’s designs represent Christianity and his faith in God. On his right shoulder, for example, he has a modified ink image of Jesus Christ on a cross.</p><p>Next, he has the gates of heaven inscribed on his left shoulder, topped with angel wings. A depiction of the Virgin Mary is also on the top left part of his back. These drawings reflect his strong dedication to God and his religion.</p><p>Omari also has a few text tattoos on his arms and chest. One of them states, “And even though I only had one life to live, you tell them, I lived it as if it were nine. You tell them I was ready, tell them I am OK while counting crows and passing time.”</p><p>Furthermore, Omari has several designs that reflect his free-spirited personality. For example, he has three feathers symbolizing freedom, courage, and wisdom on the inside side of his right bicep.</p><p>On his right arm, he bears the popular slogan<strong> “It is what it is.”</strong> Similarly, he has three stars tatted on his left shoulder, which represent guidance and optimism.</p><p>The actor also has a number of animal tattoos on his body. He has a turtle on his arms, for example, and a wolf, ankh, and raven pattern on his left bicep.</p><p>The wolf, ankh, and raven are symbols of knowledge, fortune, peace, and passion in Scandinavian and Egyptian mythology.</p><p>Another animal portrait may be seen on his calf, but the lion ink on the back of his right bicep has to be his favorite. Lions are traditionally regarded as a symbol of power and bravery. Surprisingly, it has a connection to his son, Brave Hardwick.</p><p>Similarly, a unique design may be observed on Omari’s left leg. It’s a tree tattoo with the words ‘Chilly Boots.’ printed on it.</p><p>It has great relevance for him because it is the title of one of his songs on his 2017 album Later Decatur. Furthermore, it is tied to his grandfathers.</p><p>Omar stated in an interview with Anthem Magazine,</p><p>“As a child, I had one grandfather nickname me Chilly, and the other gave me boots every Christmas.”</p><p>That describes the design’s meaning quite nicely. Omari Hardwick enjoys tattooing his body and claims to be addicted to it.</p><p>He got his first tattoo when he was 21, and since then, he has used his fit physique as a canvas for stunning patterns, which he wears rather well.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Without A Partner, Lori Pretty Feels Lonely</a></strong></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>actor</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Film Producer</a></span><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Alice Hollister</a></h3>Alice Hollister estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
