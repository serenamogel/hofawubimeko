<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Are Magic Spoon Treats Actually a Treat to Eat?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>It seems like just yesterday that <a href=#>Magic Spoon</a> was a little ol’ DTC brand that bombarded you with ads on Instagram about how you can finally eat a breakfast cereal that isn’t loaded with sugar and carbs. Look at them now! Magic Spoon has become a cereal aisle fixture at loads of national retailers (alongside plenty of imitators, I might add). Anyway, I suppose it was only a matter of time until Magic Spoon expanded its low carb, high protein offerings, and sure enough Magic Spoon Treats are hitting stores in two flavors, Marshmallow and Chocolatey Peanut Butter. Like the cereal itself, these treats are sweetened with allulose, a virtually calorie-free <a href=#>sugar alternative</a> that’s found in things like figs and wheat. Are cereal treats without sugar (or grains or soy or wheat) an actual treat? We tasted them to find out.&nbsp;</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="magic spoon treats marshmallow" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/NPR_MAGIC-SPOON-TREATS_INSET-MARSHMALLOW.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">New Product!</p><strong>Magic Spoon Treats Marshmallow</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Magic Spoon</a><p>Right off the bat, I gotta say that these are much better than I’d expected, in part because they aren’t made entirely of Magic Spoon cereal. The bulk of the bar is constructed from a grain-free dupe for puffed rice with some halved bits of Magic Spoon loops in the mix. They’re crispier than I expected, although they’re definitely less gooey than a lot of cereal treats. I am fine with that. You know why? Goo is marshmallow and marshmallow is sugar and these aren’t made with sugar! They’re kind of their own thing, although they do still have a marshmallowy flavor.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> As the box advertises, these are much better for you than the typical cereal treat. They have only 1 gram of sugar, 1 net carb, and 11 grams of protein per bar. And even though they’re made from casein, a milk protein, rather than grain, they’re still pretty crispy and satisfying. As my colleague <a href=#>Justine Sterling</a> said, “I would totally eat one of these in the car and feel better about it than eating a Nature Valley granola bar.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> They do have a little bit of an odd, off aftertaste. It’s the same aftertaste that prevented me from really getting hooked on Magic Spoon, even when I brought a bunch home after our Magic Spoon taste test. There’s something a little saccharine and artificial about the sweetness that keeps me from wanting to take another bite.</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>6.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="magic spoon treats chocolatey peanut butter" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/NPR_MAGIC-SPOON-TREATS_INSET-CHOCOLATE-PEANUT-BUTTER.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">New Product!</p><strong>Magic Spoon Treats Chocolatey Peanut Butter</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Magic Spoon</a><p>Of the two flavors of Magic Spoon Treats, I think Chocolatey Peanut Butter is the much better option. You get big, bold <a href=#>peanut butter</a> flavor upon first bite and it really works. More cereal treats should be peanut butter flavored, honestly. The chocolatey drizzle adds a little bit of sweetness, but the bar as a whole isn’t sickeningly sweet. It’s light and crispy and seems like a really good snack if you want something easy, tasty, and full of protein.</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Macros-wise, these are great, too. You get 1 gram of sugar, 2 net carbs, and 11 grams of protein. (BTW, if you look at the nutritional info on the box rather than on the packaging of an individual bar, you’ll see that each bar actually has 17 grams of carbs, but they subtract from that based on the grams of fiber, allulose, and glycerine. Is it girl math or math math?? I don’t know, but they seem to stand by it!) These bars’ biggest virtue is their big peanutty flavor. I’m sorry, people with peanut allergies!</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>These treats still have a little bit of an aftertaste, but the bold peanut butter flavor just about covers it up. I actually brought this box of treats home!</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><a href=# class="lazy-load-youtube preview-lazyload preview-youtube" data-video-title="Tomato Soup & Grilled Cheese SOUP DUMPLINGS?! | Sporked" title='Play video "Tomato Soup & Grilled Cheese SOUP DUMPLINGS?! | Sporked"' rel=noopener>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgbDU7SGRaE&list=PLHbjKrchTZzsSSNxQfCn9JpW3evHOmxqK</a></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKWRnLakedKppqimXam%2Fpq3TrGSrnaaesrh7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./janna-lapidus-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Janna Lapidus Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</span></a>
