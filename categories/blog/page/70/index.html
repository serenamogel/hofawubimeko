Back at CeBit 2014 we ran a news item regarding a couple of Sapphire branded AMD GPUs that used double the video memory of the standard R9 290X. It was going to be an interesting exercise to see if Sapphire were merely showing units and gauging interest, or if they were actually going to come to market with these 8GB behemoths. It would seem the Vapor-X model is at least hitting the shelves, although with only one retailer for a worldwide exclusive.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Is Ryan from High School Musical gay?</h2><time>Feb 12, 2024</time>

We’re just a few years away from High School Musical‘s 20-year anniversary, but although 2006 feels like a lifetime ago, the rumors surrounding the cast and characters of Disney Channel’s most successful original movie are still running rampant. For a long time, it was believed that Ryan Evans — brother to Ashley Tisdale’s Sharpay — was gay. Besides mere speculation, we never got any true confirmation as to Ryan’s sexual orientation… until now.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Pokmon Detective Pikachu Original Motion Picture Soundtrack</h2><time>Feb 12, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../../spielberg-2017.html></a>
For the majority of its running time, “Spielberg” moves chronologically. In fact, it’s at its most interesting when it chooses not to apply that rigid structure, occasionally spinning off into tangents such as how Spielberg works with fear, his focus on father-son relationships, and his interesting recent role as one of cinema’s most interesting historians. Spielberg’s films are so well-known that stories about their power or value feel repetitive. “Jaws” is terrifying, “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” is ambitious, “Schindler’s List” is personal and powerful—we know all that.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Juliana Semenova- Wiki, Height, Net Worth, Boyfriend</h2><time>Feb 10, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../../star-wars-episode-i-the-phantom-menace-1999.html></a>
Set against awesome backdrops, the characters in "The Phantom Menace" inhabit a plot that is little more complex than the stories I grew up on in science-fiction magazines. The whole series sometimes feel like a cover from Thrilling Wonder Stories, come to life. The dialogue is pretty flat and straightforward, although seasoned with a little quasi-classical formality, as if the characters had read but not retained "Julius Caesar."
