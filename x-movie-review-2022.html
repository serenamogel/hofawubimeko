<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>X movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2022)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>This scene and its mounting meta-commentary describe "X"'s reason for being in a nutshell: it’s an icky good time that's primarily a love letter to the filmmaking process. Structural shifts and tonal sleight-of-hand are part of its self-referential approach. "X" is&nbsp;a clever formal experiment, but one that plays like a feature-length joke for horror fans and filmmakers rather than offering a distinct perspective. West conjures nasty fun&nbsp;with a genre enthusiast’s expertise and then&nbsp;doesn't offer much beyond that.</p><p>The grist for this gory, sexy mill comes in the form of would-be adult film empresario Wayne (<a href=#>Martin Henderson</a>), his girlfriend Maxine (<a href=#>Mia Goth</a>), burlesque dancer Bobby-Lynne (<a href=#>Brittany Snow</a>), and Bobby-Lynne’s boyfriend/co-star Jackson (Scott “<a href=#>Kid Cudi</a>” Mescudi), in addition to RJ and Lorraine. It’s 1979, and Wayne has booked the crew space on a farm outside Houston to shoot their movie “The Farmer’s Daughters,” which he expects will be a hit on the emerging home video market.</p><p>Wayne’s chosen location is a rickety, creepy cabin owned by Howard (<a href=#>Stephen Ure</a>), an old coot who disapproves of Wayne and his crew. Howard’s invalid wife Pearl, whose impressive casting I won’t reveal, envies the group’s youth and virility, and is particularly drawn to the determined-but-insecure Maxine. Anyone picking up “The Texas Chain Saw&nbsp;Massacre” vibes or making note of RJ and Lorraine’s “Psycho” discussion can see where this is headed. Suffice it to say that as evening descends, the body count rises.&nbsp;</p><p>West delights in the atmosphere of his setting and the historical hallmarks of the lurid sandboxes he’s playing in. His knowledge and humor is evident in Maxine’s Linda Lovelace-inspired hair and makeup, the swampy, sweaty heat of the film’s coastal Texas locale, and Jackson’s baby-blue leisure suit and perfect afro.</p><p>The film crew’s “let’s-put-on-a-show” ethos highlights the plucky, hard-fought joys of low-budget filmmaking, recalling movies like “<a href=#>Ed Wood</a>” or “Dolemite is My Name.” When the focus switches to out-and-out horror, the source of “X’s” enthusiasm and devotion also changes. Instead of the characters being energized by the ad-hoc creative process, it’s West himself who radiates excitement, nearly becoming an off-camera character as “X” gleefully picks off its filmmaker proxies one by one.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46xZKanpp6ybr7Er6Cer11nfXN%2B</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pamela-anderson.html><span>←</span><span>Pamela Anderson movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</span></a>
