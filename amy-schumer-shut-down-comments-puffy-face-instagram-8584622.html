I've enjoyed feedback and deliberation about my appearance as all women do for almost 20 years," Schumer sarcastically wrote alongside a promo poster for her new series, before confirming: "And you're right, it is puffier than normal right now." Amy reminded fans that she has endometriosis, a painful medical condition that causes tissue to grow outside the uterus. She added, "There are some medical and hormonal things going on in my world right now but I'm okay."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Amy went on to explain that "a woman doesn’t need any excuse for her physical appearance and owes no explanation," but she "wanted to take the opportunity to advocate for self love and acceptance of the skin you’re in." She continued, "Like every other women/person some days I feel confident and good as hell and others I want to put a bag over my head. But I feel strong and beautiful and so proud of this tv show I created. Wrote. Starred in and directed. Maybe just maybe we can focus on that for a little."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This isn't the first time Amy has been candid about her endometriosis diagnosis. Back in September 2021, she revealed that she had&nbsp;undergone surgery to remove her uterus and appendix&nbsp;due to the condition. "So, it's the morning after my surgery for endometriosis and my uterus is out. The doctor found 30 spots of endometriosis that he removed. He removed my appendix because the endometriosis had attacked it," Schumer previously shared in a video posted to Instagram. "There was a lot, a lot of blood in my uterus and I'm, you know, sore and I have some, like, gas pains."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A year later, she was happy to report that she felt like a "new person" following the procedure.
