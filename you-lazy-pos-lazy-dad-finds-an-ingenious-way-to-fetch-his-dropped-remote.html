Instead of getting up to retrieve the device, Lomas came up with the clever idea to use Miya.</p><p data-characters=278 data-current-count=278 data-injectable=false>In the upload, Lomas is seen picking up the infant and gently placing her in the direction of where the remote is. Almost immediately following that step, it appeared that the duo had been here before because without hesitation, Miya picked up the remote and handed it to Lomas.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=578 data-injectable=true><a title=@alixandstephen href=#>@alixandstephen</a><p><a title=dads href=#>#dads</a> @AlixCasey @Stephen Lomas <a title=parents href=#>#parents</a><a title=reaction href=#>#reaction</a><a title=alixandstephen href=#>#alixandstephen</a><a title=kc href=#>#kc</a><a title=family href=#>#family</a><a title=baby href=#>#baby</a><a title=cute href=#>#cute</a><a title=kansascity href=#>#kansascity</a><a title=love href=#>#love</a><a title=dad href=#>#dad</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Alix & Stephen Show" href=#>♬ original sound – Alix & Stephen Show</a></figure><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=383 data-injectable=false>As all this was happening, a stunned Blahnik called Lomas out for being incredibly lazy. She stated, “You lazy POS. That’s so funny.” Lomas responded by making an inaudible sound. When Blahnik asked what that was, Lomas explained that it was a dinosaur. Towards the end of the clip, she added that she considered Lomas’ idea a complete “dad move.”</p><p>“Well if that’s not a dad move I don’t know what is.”</p><p data-characters=254 data-current-count=254 data-injectable=false>Since the post has been shared with the public, it has generated over 16 million views and received more than 3 million likes.
