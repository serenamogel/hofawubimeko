All their products are claimed to be made from real fruit juices. The company later launched a few exotic fruit and vegetable flavors.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span></p><p>The use of natural ingredients, authentic flavors, and attractive packaging made the company unique. Jamie runs the business along with two of his friends namely Ed Williams and Warren Crane.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_11"></span></p><h1 style=text-align:center><strong>Frequently Asked Questions About Jamie Laing</strong></h1><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-jamie-laing></span><strong>Who is Jamie Laing?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jamie Laing is a British actor, entrepreneur, and social media influencer who was born and brought up in Oxford, England.
