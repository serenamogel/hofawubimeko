However, she suddenly seemed to go back on her promise through a tweet.&nbsp;It turns out that the entire stepping down thing is still in the works.</p><h2>Ninja’s Wife Is Concentrating on Building Her Brand</h2><p>Ninja’s wife said in an interview with Sportify It that she was preparing to transcend beyond her husband’s brand and establish her own identity in the streaming arena.&nbsp;Jessica is also not to be underestimated. While ensuring her husband’s commercial success, she’d managed to build her own fan base.&nbsp;Her Dead By Daylight feeds have the most followers, although most people know her as Ninja’s wife and manager.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Ninjas-Wife-1.jpg alt="Ninja's Wife" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Jessica Blevins is expanding her brand alongside her husband’s.</h2><p>Jessica said that she had committed a large portion of her time and energy to establish her own business alongside her husband’s for a whole year. She’d basically followed the same technique that had elevated her husband from a streamer with a big fanbase to a real superstar.</p><p>“I’m quite thrilled,” she said. “I have a public relations staff. I signed a contract with CAA. I used to concentrate on Tyler, but now I’m focused on my brand as well.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Ninja-1.jpg alt=Ninja width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>That’s when the schism with the Ninja squad began. She’s working on a book and has had a good number of offers, no doubt, thanks to her PR firm’s diligent efforts. That means more time spent on her brand and less time accessible for Ninja.</p><h2>Jessica Blevins is departing from Team Ninja.</h2><p>Jessica said that she was “very conflicted” at the time and that committing all of her attention to her own business was a genuine consideration.&nbsp;Nonetheless, she informed the outlet that they were the first in the public domain to learn about this.&nbsp;We’re understanding that there will be a day when I won’t be his manager anymore, and it may happen sooner rather than later. She openly said that, given the amount of work she performed for Team Ninja, they would need a full-time successor for her role, and that person would have to be someone they could trust.</p><p>Or, as she described it, “someone that eats, breathes, and sleeps Ninja-like I do.” Only then could she take a step back and concentrate on her own job.&nbsp;Having said that, she also said that Ninja was “very supportive” and that he just wanted her to be happy.</p><h2>‘Sooner rather than later’ — No, not at all!</h2><p>The interview, understandably, gave the impression that Jessica’s decision to quit Team Ninja was imminent and several sites covered it as such.&nbsp;Jessica just sent a tweet to set the record right.&nbsp;She addressed all of the stories that were going around the internet and reiterated that she would be stepping down from her management role in the event that her spouse receives the entire concentration and time that she had been providing him.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Ninja-2.jpg alt=Ninja width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>“BUT,” she continued. “I’m still happy and effectively juggling him and myself. I’m not leaving just yet.” s a result, she confirmed that there were still a few practical changes to be made before she parted ways with her husband’s business life and that such adjustments would take time.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiloqaalsBuw8ifnGaho2KwsLrCnqWtqpGptq%2BzjKilZpqlnrmltc2gZKGdomK8uLqMm6mappRk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./last-chance-harvey-2009.html><span>←</span><span>Last Chance Harvey movie review (2009)</span></a>
