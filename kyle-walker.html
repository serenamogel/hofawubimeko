That definitely speaks volumes about his potential and his worth for the club. The right back has played for many years in the Premier League, most notably at the Spurs before his move to Man. City. He earned a massive salary at Spurs (4 Million Euro) which was almost doubled when he moved to Manchester (8 Million Euro). His net worth is estimated to be about 29 Million Euro (25 Million Pound). His market value is obviously very high, given the fact that he was once the most expensive defender in the whole world. In recent years the transfermarket has gone absolutely beserk so we think this right footed defender is worth about 80 Million Euro (70 Million Pound).<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uMDFqKatZpOkunC8y5qwnqpfoMatsYywmKWjlad8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jorge-hank-rhon.html><span>←</span><span>Jorge Hank Rhon Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</span></a>
