There is no telling just how the social media platform would choose to display photos, once uploaded. Most of the time, you would have to hit 'tweet' and hope for the best.</p><p>However, Twitter is all set to change that with its new cropping feature that allows you to upload vertical photos and skip the whole 'bad algorithm crop'-induced embarrassment. Turns out, one of the people ready to make the most of this new feature is none other than singer Troye Sivan. The artist took to Twitter to mention just how he intends to use the crop feature. And let's just say, it's been a 'long' time coming.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p>Seeing that Twitter is finally doing away with its old algorithm-based cropping, Sivan was quick to put out a series of tweets, excited over the same. The first tweet titled "No more Twitter crop" featured the artist in a beautiful co-ord set, twirling in a room of mirrors.</p><p>The photo was artsy, cool and everything in between. His follow-up tweet, however, is one that had his entire fanbase chuckling endlessly. The artist tweeted, "No more Twitter crop can finally post my long shlong," to his 9.1M followers.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>No more Twitter crop</p>‚Äî troye (@troyesivan) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">May 5, 2021</a><p dir=ltr lang=en>No more Twitter crop can finally post my long shlong üëÄü§©</p>‚Äî troye (@troyesivan) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">May 5, 2021</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p>Obviously, there were quite a few reactions that came pouring in. And the memes were endless. "how it feels to defend you every time you tweet something insane," tweeted a user. "The fact that we can‚Äôt tell if this is you or a hacker says a lot in my opinion," said another user. "Your management calling you after reading this tweet," joked another. "troye after tweeting this knowing he‚Äôs on thin ice," added a fan.
