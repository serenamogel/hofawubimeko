That’s why each year when summer rolls around, we update our burger bun ranking to make sure all of the Grill Dads (a decidedly gender-neutral term) are working with the most up-to-date recommendations. We’ve got some really great finds on here, from classic buns to seeded buns to pretzel buns—and we’ve even included the best gluten free hamburger bun we’ve tried to date. After three separate taste tests, we’re proud of this list and we stand by it. Which buns cracked the top 13?

Say you’re having a party for more than ten people and you just want reliable consistency—this is where Ballpark comes in. If you’re churning out burgers and <a href=#>hot dogs</a> on a grill and are looking for an inoffensive, good quality bun, Ballpark makes the best burger buns for you. These buns make me think of cheap beer and a standard burger, which is never a bad thing.

Udi’s gluten free burger buns are a little more grainy and dry than standard burger buns, but the gluten free fam knows the deal. Believe it or not, these are softer, springier, and more moist than everyone’s typical favorite GF bread brand, Schär. With their shiny tops, even proportions, and larger size, they also look more like regular burger buns. I know that might throw some of you for a loop, but it’s true!

They’re fluffy, sweet, and just a little bit doughy. Quite honestly, these satisfied our indulgent, fancy food cravings more than any brioche buns we tried—none of which ended up making our list of the best hamburger buns. These probably aren’t the best burger buns for a plain or meagerly topped burger, but if you’re adding some <a href=#>bacon</a>, <a href=#>sharp cheddar</a>, or <a href=#>flavored mayonnaise</a>, these buns will complement those ingredients well. They’re meaty and doughy in a way that works with a lot of toppings.

They’re dusted with flour as if they just came out of the oven. And they come cut all the way through, so you don’t have to worry about ripping into the bun too much. They’re a little sweet, wonderfully chewy, and sturdy enough to handle a couple of smash burger patties. I do think they could use some toasting (but I’m a toasted bun kind of gal). They’re made without bleached flour and they tout 6 grams of protein. Want to feel a little better about scarfing down a greasy burger?

The potato flavor is great, and they are quite soft, too. Oroweat’s Country Potato hamburger buns are dusted with flour for that bakery-fresh aesthetic, and the sweetness here is really great. Again, these buns are huge and can withstand a whole lot of toppings. If you love a fried egg on top of your burger, these would hold that slippery yolkiness well. Some commenters on Amazon mentioned that these buns don’t last very long if they’re left out at room temperature since they’re free of preservatives, so that’s something to keep in mind. —Danny Palumbo</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde / Amazon</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="King’s Hawaiian Sweet Hamburger Buns" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/RANKING-UPDATE_HAMBURGET-BUNS_INSET-_0000s_0005_07.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Sweet</p><strong><strong>&nbsp;King’s Hawaiian Sweet Hamburger Buns</strong></strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>Naturally, King’s Hawaiian burger buns are much sweeter than the other burger buns on this list. It could be too much for your average burger eater. But the sweetness makes these the best hamburger buns to pair with spice—so if you like chili peppers, sriracha mayo, pickled jalapeños, and the like on your burgers, these buns provide a good balance.

(That’s how good these burger buns are, they inspired that level of poetry.) It’s definitely not too wheaty, either. If you’re opting for a slightly healthier bun, this is the best burger bun to buy.

They check every box you want to check when you’re looking for the best hamburger buns: The squish factor is great, the texture is wonderful, and the flavor is sweet. Combine that with the toasty, salty flavor of a pretzel, and this is a damn winner. The sweet and salty flavors play off of each other really, really well, and the soft texture is a damn delight. King’s Hawaiian rolls are iconically squishy and sweet, and the burger bun version only confirms their stellar reputation. (They’re also the only pick when it comes to the <a href=#>best slider buns</a>.) These were the buns we couldn’t stop eating.
