But it was almost so different from Tom Hiddleston’s Loki, as this frankly bizarre piece of MCU concept art from Charlie Wen (h/t <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ComicBook.com</a>) attests:</p><p>Wacky Loki! My first sketch of him as someone a bit off for the first #thor There were other options but this is the looniest one so I wanted to share. As I think of his backstory and focused on the manipulative bent than his relationship with his bro Thor which develops later, I put more character depth in his final version. At this time I also wanted to play with the idea that Asgard had magic based on science beyond human tech understanding. I’ll post the final Thor I Lokis next!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Loki-Avengers.jpg><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=270 data-injectable=false>It’s certainly… different. Indeed, it looks as if Loki has been hoking around in Rita Repulsa’s wardrobe, resulting in a costume that’s much more operatic and, frankly, ridiculous than the one worn by Tom Hiddleston all throughout his MCU career.</p><p data-characters=289 data-current-count=559 data-injectable=false>Chances are he’ll feature at some point in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Avengers 4</strong></a>, given leaked set photos captured Hiddleston in his Phase One attire. That remains to be confirmed, of course, but we’ll find out one way or another on May 3rd, 2019, when the&nbsp;Infinity War&nbsp;sequel touches down in theaters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomaKykae%2FpnnMnKxmm5%2BjsKa802aYq6xdp7K3scClqmaZXauys8WMnaCfnpWnsq%2FAjKWmpKFf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mike-tagliere.html><span>←</span><span>Mike Tagliere</span></a>
