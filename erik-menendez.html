On August 20, 1989, the Menendez brothers shot their parents, José and Kitty, at their home in Beverly Hills. During their highly publicized trials, which began in 1993, the brothers claimed they acted in self-defense after years of physical and sexual abuse. Both were convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole in 1996. Erik got married three years later and is still with his wife, Tammi, who wrote a book about their relationship in 2005. In 2023, the Menendez brothers filed a petition to vacate their convictions based on new evidence supporting their earlier testimonies that José sexually abused them.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: Erik Galen Menendez<br>BORN: November 27, 1970<br>BIRTHPLACE: Blackwood, New Jersey<br>SPOUSE: Tammi Ruth Saccoman (1999-present)<br>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Sagittarius<br></p><h2 data-node-id=9 title="Early Life" data-anchor-id=early-life class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Erik Galen Menendez was born on November 27, 1970, in Blackwood, New Jersey, the younger son of José and Mary “Kitty” Menendez. José, a Cuban immigrant, had made himself into a successful entertainment executive, and he exerted tremendous pressure on his boys to succeed as well.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Shy and quiet, Erik grew up emulating his older brother, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/crime/lyle-menendez data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Lyle class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Lyle</a>.

The brothers separately confided in their cousins, one of whom told a disbelieving Kitty.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After the family moved to Southern California in 1986, Erik and Lyle fell in with more of a troublemaking crowd.

His father put tremendous pressure on him to succeed in athletics, academics, and everything else.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“It seemed like José was so competitive, he was doing everything he could to try to make [Erik] better,” their former swim team coach <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-07-22-tm-930-story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told the Los Angeles Times" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">told the Los Angeles Times</a> in 1990. “But he was so completely overbearing, it had the opposite effect.

It’s still happening Andy, but it’s worse for me now,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cliffgardner.com/In_re_Menendez_Petition_5-1-23_version_with_counsel.pdf data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the letter reads" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">the letter reads</a>. “I can’t explain it.

José was shot six times with a shotgun, while Kitty suffered 10 gunshot wounds. The crime was so brutal that police initially believed the slayings <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-08-30-me-1259-story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="were a mob hit" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">were a mob hit</a>. Lyle called the police to report the murders, nearly two hours after they had taken place.

Erik hired a personal tennis coach, spent money on flights abroad to compete in matches, and even put $40,000 into funding a Los Angeles rock concert. The two brothers spent <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/19/beverly-hills-greed-the-missteps-that-exposed-the-menendez-brothers.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="a total of $700,000" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">a total of $700,000</a> in the six months after their parents’ deaths.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">However, Erik was also becoming burdened with guilt, and in late October, he confessed the crimes to his therapist, L.

Upon learning of this, Lyle reportedly grew angry and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-08-06-me-20977-story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="threatened to kill" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">threatened to kill</a> Oziel if he told anyone else. But the therapist confided in his girlfriend, who in turn tipped off the police.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The brothers were arrested within days of each other in March 1990, and in late December 1992, they were indicted for first-degree murder. Tape recordings made by Oziel became a subject of legal jousting over the issue of doctor-patient privilege violation. Eventually, some of the tapes were <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-menendez-19910321-story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="admitted as evidence" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">admitted as evidence</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 title="Trials and Conviction" data-anchor-id=trials-and-conviction class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Trials and Conviction</h2><img alt="two young men in prison jumpsuits speak behind the back of a lawyer seated between them in a courtroom" title="Erik and Lyle Menendez in court in February 1995" width=1535 height=962 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/erik-and-lyle-menendez-converse-in-the-courtroom-during-a-news-photo-1696966788.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Erik and Lyle Menendez converse in the courtroom during a hearing in Los Angeles in February 1995.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The Menendez brothers’ trials went on to become a national sensation due to their broadcast <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://ew.com/article/1993/11/12/confessions-court-tv-addict/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="on Court TV" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">on Court TV</a>, then a relatively new cable television channel that later became TruTV. In July 1993, the trial for Erik and Lyle began, with separate juries designated for each defendant. The brothers testified that they had been subjected to years of verbal, physical, and sexual abuse. Their cousin Andy Cano also took the stand to back their abuse claims.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The night of the murders, the brothers claimed Lyle threatened to expose their father as a child molester, then they began to fear he would to kill them to keep them silent. “I thought I was going to die,” Erik <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-09-29-mn-40297-story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="testified about that night" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">testified about that night</a>. In response, Erik claimed the brothers retrieved their shotguns, entered the den where their parents stood, and “just started firing.” He claimed to recall few specific details about the actual killings.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Prosecutors, who were seeking the death penalty, countered that the brothers wanted to get their hands on the family fortune. Shortly before he was killed, José Menendez reportedly discussed plans to write his sons <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-10-28-me-50394-story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="out of his will" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">out of his will</a>, which prosecutors cited as a motive for the murders. In January 1994, a mistrial was declared when the juries were unable to decide on whether to convict for manslaughter or murder.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A second trial began the following year, this time with just one jury and no cameras present.

The brothers were convicted of first-degree murder in March 1996 and later sentenced to consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=29 title="Life in Prison" data-anchor-id=life-in-prison class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Life in Prison</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Erik was originally sent to California’s Folsom State Prison, then later transferred downstate to Pleasant Valley State Prison. He spent years seeking a new trial after his 1996 conviction, fighting his way through the California courts along with his brother, but they were denied at every turn. In 2005, the case reached a federal appeals court, which refused to grant the Menendez brothers a new trial.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">During an interview to promote his wife’s 2005 book, Erik expressed remorse over his parents’ murders, referring to his awareness of the crimes as “my real prison.” “People view me as this dark guy, a killer... It’s always been a struggle for me to realize that I’m the nation’s villain,” he <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/celebrity/erik-menendez-the-people-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told People magazine" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">told People magazine</a>.“I’m really not.
