<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Secret Invasion is breaking lots of conventions, so can male friendship be one of them?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p data-characters=477 data-injectable=true data-video=true><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Secret Invasion</a></strong> is already proving to be an absolute maverick in the realm of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>; it’s not uncommon for the franchise’s Disney Plus shows to bend and break the rules that the theatrical releases seem bound to, but with its markedly more mature tone, earth-shattering plot beats, and mounds of political intrigue that we’ve only scratched the surface of, Secret Invasion looks to be playing a whole other game after just one episode.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=513 data-current-count=513 data-injectable=true>Speaking of breaking conventions, the inaugural chapter of Secret Invasion saw <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nick Fury</a> rendezvous with his old friend and ally <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Talos</a>, with whom he shared a tender forehead touch upon their reunion. Not long after that moment did Google get bombarded with searches in the vein of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">whether Fury was gay or not</a>, and as a queer person who desires more queer media representation, is highly critical of the state of it, and overall takes it quite seriously, I hope to hope itself that Nick Fury is a heterosexual man.</p><p data-characters=377 data-current-count=377 data-injectable=false>The forehead touch scene was nothing short of beautiful; the way these two men embraced one another as they seemed to balance an increasingly volatile world on their shoulders, both of them thankful for a trusted confidant and the brief solace they brought to one another, had a poignant tenderness to it that I reckon will be difficult to find throughout the rest of the show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Nick-Fury-in-Secret-Invasion-2.jpg><p data-characters=535 data-current-count=535 data-injectable=true>My question is, why can’t these two longtime friends, burdened by the weight of worldwide, radioactive warfare that could erupt at any moment, show their trust and platonic love for one another without having their sexuality called into question just because they’re both male? Sure, physical affection may be a touch out of character for someone like Fury, but when the straits are as dire as they are in Secret Invasion, close comfort from friends would no doubt transcend any ego, even one as pronounced as Fury’s.</p><p data-characters=577 data-current-count=577 data-injectable=true>All this to say that intimate, platonic male friendship is, unfortunately, not your typical customer on the media representation front, but Secret Invasion also doesn’t happen to be your typical MCU series. Now, with the many twists and turns that the show has taken so far, all bets, including Fury’s sexuality or even whether or not Fury is really Fury, are off the table; that being said, Marvel has a real opportunity to commit to a beautiful, healthy, much-needed depiction of masculinity right now, and I hope this particular wish of mine ends up coming true.</p><p data-characters=126 data-current-count=126 data-injectable=false>Secret Invasion is now streaming on Disney Plus. New episodes will release every Wednesday until the series finale on July 26.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y0scKrnK1lmaPDor%2FIqKVmoaNir7OxwKSgp59doby1v4yonWabn6PDprrToqanq12ovG6vwKdkppmcmnqnvsiepZ2rmJ69bq7EZqannV2ks27Ax56kaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./celebrities-born-on-the-fourth-of-july.html><span>←</span><span>10 celebrities born on the Fourth of July</span></a>
