There is a lack of information regarding how the MCU’s Black Panther met her.</p><p>Nevertheless, the 5’5″ hairdresser was responsible for most of Boseman’s appearance. Her noteworthy work for him was in Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, Da 5 Bloods, 21 Bridges, Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War, and Avengers: Endgame.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Deidra-and-Chadwick-were-close-friends.jpg><p>Sadly, on August 28, 2020, the actor passed away due to cancer, leaving Deidra Dixon broken.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Deidras_Other_Interests></span>Deidra’s Other Interests<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Painting, writing, and doing nail arts are what interests Deidra aside from her Hollywood work. Most of her writeups are one-liners and quotes rather than poems. Jamie Foxx’s sister, Deidra, focuses on self-motivation, acceptance, and the power of love.</p><p>The hair department head’s painting and nail arts, on the other hand, is highly inspired by her spiritual nature. Most of her work is bright and a combination of various colors which provides it extra life.</p><p>With all that said, Deidra Dixon is single and living with her brother Jamie Foxx in Los Angeles, California. 2020 was tough for her as she lost two of her loved ones, but hopefully, she gets a speedy recovery and jumps back with her future endeavors.</p><p>Lastly, we wish the best to Deidra Dixon for her healthy life and continue to live happily.</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>For more updates on&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Entertainment</span></strong></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Celebrity Babies</span></strong></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>YouTubers</span></strong></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, and&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Movies TV Series</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;follow&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>eCelebrityMirror</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>.</span></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidk5q5pq7RoquypZmnv7C%2BjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq7Jlo56vrbXNoKpoopGitqZ5xaivsWWjnsC1sdFmm56hlKeubrDIsaanZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./suniljoseph.html><span>←</span><span>Sunil Joseph, Author at Ringside News</span></a>
