There’s a lot of conversation around how much a dollar will get you these days. Hell, things at Dollar Tree don’t even cost a dollar anymore! That’s why I’m giving you the rundown of the Dollar Tree groceries that are cheap but also looks fun as hell. Yeah, we shop at Dollar Tree for bargains, but that doesn’t mean we’re content to settle for rice and beans. Here’s what to buy at Dollar Tree this month.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Betty Crocker </strong></a><strong><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Southwest Style Queso</strong></a> Potato Scrambles Kit</strong><p>I love seeing what the little food scientist freaks will come up with, and shopping at Dollar Tree is a great way to find some truly unique things. This skillet meal isn’t too revolutionary, but it seems like a nice way to have a unique hash for your Sunday morning brunch. You’ll need to add your own sausage and eggs to the mix, but for only $1.25, this one’s worth a try.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Frankford Kraft Gummy Assorted Snack Pack</strong></a><p>Speaking of those little freaks in the lab, they really outdid themselves with this three-pack of gummies. Kraft mac and cheese, Oscar Mayer hot dogs, and Claussen pickle gummies all in one box? Buy this for any adventurous eater in your life and watch their eyes light up as they behold the oddities and absurdities of the food world. The box does say “fruit flavored” gummy candy—I’m not familiar with a mac and cheese fruit so I have some questions, but it’s still a fun thing to buy at Dollar Tree this month if you spot it at your local store.</p><strong>Tapatio Queso Blanco Mac and Cheese</strong><p>Sporked’s Jordan Myrick recently went to the Sweets and Snacks Expo and brought back <a href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHN3V8KXOqs" rel=noopener>a big haul</a> of new products for everyone at the office to try, and of the items in their bag of goodies was a box of Tapatio Queso Blanco Mac and Cheese. I did not get an invite to the snack tasting but as luck would have it, I found some at Dollar Tree. I looked around online and could only really find this sold by shady dealers on eBay. So if you’re looking to get your hands on this before the masses, try your local Dollar Tree of all places!</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Feastables MrBeast Peanut Butter Chocolate Snack Bars</strong></a><p>Dollar Tree really is full of surprises sometimes! I didn’t even know MrBeast made snack bars and I definitely didn’t expect to find them at Dollar Tree. Will these be amazing? I mean, it’s sort of doubtful, but they’re a fun thing try out on the cheap. Unless you’re MrBeast reading this, then I think you’re a culinary genius and I’d love to get a million dollars for sending people your way.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Rip It Tribute Cherry Lime</strong></a><p>It’s almost the Fourth of July, and nothing says patriotism quite an energy drink emblazoned with the American flag! Looking past the gaudy branding and the obvious joke, I do think this would be an enjoyable and on-brand summer energy drink from Dollar Tree. The combo of cherry and lime has major summer vibes, so if you’re looking for what to buy at Dollar Tree for a forthcoming BBQ with a lot of Lee Greenwood lovers in attendance, you can’t go wrong with a few cans of this stuff.</p><a href=#><strong>Oreo Peanut Butter Creme Cakesters</strong></a><p>I truly love the original Oreo Cakesters with my entire being. That said, I understand some people might be hesitant to buy a full box of the new peanut butter variety at the grocery store. The Sporked crew <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/peanut-butter-oreo-cakesters-review/>didn’t exactly rave about these</a>, but a three-pack at Dollar Tree is cheap enough that you can see for yourself if you’re a fan.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Corn Nuts Mexican Street Style Corn</strong></a><p>Nothing satisfies on a hot June evening quite likes some street corn on a stick. But if you don’t live in an area where an elotes cart is easy to find, you can settle for these Mexican Street Style Corn-flavored Corn Nuts. Pair a bag of these crunchy little morsels with one of the <a href=# rel=noopener>Minute Maid aguas frescas</a> that I also spotted at Dollar Tree, and you’ve got yourself the next best thing to the original.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Betty Crocker Pumpkin Spice Cookie Mix</strong></a><p>You read that right—Dollar Tree is selling pumpkin spice cookies in June! I laughed this one off at first, but then the wheels started turning. This is actually the perfect thing to buy at Dollar Tree in June. If you failed your calculations on stocking up on all things pumpkin spice-flavored last October, fret not—Dollar Tree’s got your back. Get an extra hit of the good stuff before pumpkin spice starts trickling back into stores in a few short months!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BYlsFuwM5mma6xXZbBbrDOpaOaql2pv6axjK2foqtdoryvwMdmoa6mlWJ%2FcX6TaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./danielle-fishel-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Danielle Fishel Net Worth 2024</span></a>
