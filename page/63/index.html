Far from her early career roots in the ever-graphic Fifty Shades film franchise, actress Dakota Johnson has graduated to the colossal Marvel bubble with a leading role as Cassie Webb in Madame Web. But as intriguing as Johnson appearing in a Marvel movie undoubtedly is, folks are apparently far more interested in a separate theory — the possibility of the actress getting plastic surgery.

Olivia Rodrigo arrived at the&nbsp;2024 Grammy Awards&nbsp;in a throwback white gown littered with tiny red crystals, but for her performance, she swapped the subtle nod to "Vampire" for a more overt full-on red dress — and the bloody references didn't stop there. Rodrigo, who is nominated for six awards tonight thanks to her sophomore album,&nbsp;GUTS, smeared herself with faux blood as she performed the album's lead track. Rodrigo started the ballad in a simple red Naeem Khan gown with a plunging, deep-V silhouette and floor-grazing hem.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Securifi Updates Smart Home Hub Lineup with New Almond 3 Wireless Router</h2><time>Mar 9, 2024</time>

Securifi is famous for bringing out the world's first commercially available touchscreen router. We have covered them a couple of times in the past. They were one of the first vendors to realize the potential of integrating radios for home automation protocols (ZigBee and Z-Wave) in a wireless router. Google also seems to be adopting this strategy with the OnHub routers which integrate Bluetooth and 802.15.4 support.
Securifi's family of routers (the Almonds) consists of two product lines - one targeting the high-end market and the other aiming to be more affordable.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Does Arizona forgive Callie?</h2><time>Mar 8, 2024</time>

The best Christmas coffee creamers turn a regular ol’ cup of coffee into a sweet, festive seasonal treat. As a person who pretty much always purchases the same coffee creamer (Chobani Sweet Cream, our numero uno best coffee creamer of them all), I don’t typically pay a lot of attention to what hits the dairy aisle out around the holidays.

We said “Howdy!” to the Duncan Hines Dolly Parton cake mixes and frostings in our office this week. The limited-edition products include Southern Style Coconut and Southern Style Banana cake mixes, as well as Creamy Chocolate Buttercream and Creamy Buttercream frostings.
I baked two whole cakes at my 9 to 5 to see how these Parton products stack up to regular store-bought cake mixes and frostings. Are these Dolly-themed packaged baking shortcuts the greatest gift of all or will I be setting down my fork before the next teardrop falls?</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Paightyn Jones Missing: Seeking Answers in the Mysterious Disappearance</h2><time>Mar 7, 2024</time>
