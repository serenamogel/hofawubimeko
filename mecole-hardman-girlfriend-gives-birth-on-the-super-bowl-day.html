OMG HER WATER BROKE 👀👀👀

It will be pretty spectacular if Gordon gives birth to a child on Super Bowl between the 12th to 13 of February, and it also works as a lucky charm for the Kansas City Chiefs."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
