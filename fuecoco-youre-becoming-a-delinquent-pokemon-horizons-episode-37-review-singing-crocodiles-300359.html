This one has eyelashes to signify that she's female, and I think it’s quite interesting actually to see a Krookodile with such a unique appearance. This isn't the first time the anime has given a Krookodile its own unique appearance, with <a href=# class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="./proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbulbapedia.bulbagarden.net%2Fwiki%2FAsh%2527s_Krookodile&hash=c1131031f286baab440cf7c6a655e4fd" rel="nofollow noopener">Ash’s Krookodile</a> having its own pair of sunglasses. I also liked the fact that Krookodile is the mother and the father is a <a href=# class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="./proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbulbapedia.bulbagarden.net%2Fwiki%2FKrokorok_%28Pok%25C3%25A9mon%29&hash=6acbc45946fa0d68cb144a9afc34bda7" rel="nofollow noopener">Krokorok</a>. I feel like it’s rare that the anime makes the bigger Pokémon female and the smaller one male, so it’s nice to see a different change in the formula.</p><p>This is primarily a Roy and Fuecoco episode. Surprisingly enough though, Roy doesn’t battle at all! All he does is dance and sing with Fuecoco and other crocodiles. I do like that he befriends them, which then helps Roy understand that Krookodile and her family aren’t the villains, and that they only attack the excavation site because the noise is bothering her babies. I also thought it was interesting that while it was hinted that Fuecoco might learn Round like how the other crocs used the move, which is a move Fuecoco can learn naturally, the writers opted for him to learn a TM move in Disarming Voice instead. If Roy wants to challenge the <a href=# class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="./proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbulbapedia.bulbagarden.net%2Fwiki%2FBlack_Rayquaza&hash=bfaa0e842db9d3af85855142634f9b14" rel="nofollow noopener">Black Rayquaza</a>, they do need the Fairy-type advantage; I wonder if Fuecoco will learn Alluring Voice later on. I don’t know about you, but Roy and Fuecoco were super adorable in this episode. The best part is that the title of this episode lied about Fuecoco turning into a delinquent. While he dons shades, Fuecoco is still a good boy.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bulbagarden.net/attachments/screenshot-2024-01-27-at-3-46-17-pm-png.182135/ data-url data-zoom-target=1 alt="Fuecoco looking a certain Pokémon hiding in the sand" title="Fuecoco looking a certain Pokémon hiding in the sand" width=2880 height=1576 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <a href=# class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="./proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbulbapedia.bulbagarden.net%2Fwiki%2FLiko&hash=55c1db8545e67e02a01050b2d7853ad6" rel="nofollow noopener">Liko</a> and <a href=# class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="./proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbulbapedia.bulbagarden.net%2Fwiki%2FFriede&hash=e4137e240cb62fea448bc4e8d493284e" rel="nofollow noopener">Friede</a> actually don’t do much in this episode. <a href=# class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="./proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbulbapedia.bulbagarden.net%2Fwiki%2FCaptain_Pikachu&hash=4ad4f76c85161263e43f9bab52b80a2b" rel="nofollow noopener">Captain Pikachu</a> also doesn’t interfere with the conflict this time too! I did like how Cap punches the quicksand and sinks down with a serious gaze while Friede and Liko are freaking out. I think the true villains of this episode are the people at the excavation site. They didn’t realize that they were bothering Krookdile’s family and even wanted Friede to exterminate them; that’s pretty dark for Pokémon standards. They also promised a hefty sum for the rock excavation, but when the croc family obliterated it with Round, their pay suffered the same fate. What jerks. Though, I do commend them for being strategic battlers.

I was honestly worried that they would’ve used <a href=# class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="./proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbulbapedia.bulbagarden.net%2Fwiki%2FLuxray_%28Pok%25C3%25A9mon%29&hash=d3a4f50f1758e8daa4f061d0634f2b3a" rel="nofollow noopener">Luxray</a> against them, but Luxray was only lookout.<p>This was a cute episode all in all. It’s nice to see Fuecoco learning a new move. Will he stop using Ember now? Who knows.
